But we do love to celebrate our staff, reflect on what we&rsquo;ve done well, and build on successes. In Summer 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sas.com/\">SAS</a>&nbsp;announced that ATB won the SAS Insight Award, granted to a Western-Canada based company for undertaking a project that was innovative, collaborative, and successfully deployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"image1.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5b7afcf003ce646d8c7a7352/1534861565149/image1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"500x314\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5b7afcf003ce646d8c7a7352\" data-image-resolution=\"1000w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5b7afcf003ce646d8c7a7352/1534861565149/image1.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5b7afcf003ce646d8c7a7352/1534861565149/image1.jpg?format=1000w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an ATB technology partner, SAS provides software to better analyze data. With over 15 years of history working together, this year, SAS presented ATB with the Insight Award to recognize the innovation behind the deployment of SAS Viya on the Google Cloud platform. It was the first ever Google Cloud deployment in North America and the first large-scale full production deployment of the SAS Viya software in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data analysis is core to our mission to provide better banking services and improve the lives of Albertans. From risk analysis and fraud detection to mobile app customization and customer service improvements, high powered data analytics can unlock huge returns in how we serve our customers. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re committed to equipping our teams with the tools to leverage machine learning, robotics process automation, computer vision, and natural language processing. Rather than having distinct groups of experts in charge of applied technology, we want team members across the organization to ideate and prototype solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of the key strategies to put the power of advanced technology in the hands of more ATB team members is founded on cloud deployments and powered by solutions like SAS. The Viya software, in particular, provides friendly user-interfaces in multiple programming languages and integrations with other technologies like Google Tensorflow.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our technology teams shift from developing tools to providing services, we need a platform that gives us access to open source and proprietary algorithms in machine learning.

In the age of fintech startups, cryptocurrencies, challenger banks, and virtual finance, the experience of banking is no longer siloed in the eyes of consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers are comparing their banking experience to the magic of getting out of an Uber &lsquo;without paying&rsquo;; the ease with which you can rent out your house on AirBnB; or signing in to Slack with a &lsquo;magic link&rsquo; instead of a password you&rsquo;ll never remember.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are taking the challenge head-on, inspired by what we&rsquo;ve heard from ATB customers: how they want to interact with their bank and their expectations for in-person and virtual interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure that we are providing exceptional experiences for our customers, we had to change some things about how we operate. One of those changes was the launch of our digital platform. Overlaying our legacy structure and processes, the platform allows our teams to build processes based on the human experiences, instead of the corporate structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first prototype built on the ATB digital platform is Onboarding Express. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/progress/four-minute-account-opening-shifting-from-transaction-to-human-interaction\">launching early in 2018</a>&nbsp;in a single branch in Calgary, it has now been rolled out to all 175 ATB branches province-wide and has been used to open over 200 new retail bank accounts. Not to mentioned giving our team members the ability to wow our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onboarding Express leverages the digital platform by eliminating the need to fill out information on multiple forms, destined for different departments, and to have customers repeat the spelling of their names and their exact address multiple times as it is entered in different systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because we have automated connections between back-end portals and removed transcription errors with solutions like scanning driver&rsquo;s licences, our team was able to overcome the constraints based on business processes and focus on building an experience based on how we want customers to feel when they are opening an account with ATB.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re welcomed to a bike-share app, it can be as pleasant as scanning a QR code on your phone and hopping on your bike in less than a minute. With this in mind, we knew there was a better way to be welcomed into the ATB family.&nbsp;<strong>As we build life-long and multi-generational relationships with ATB customers, we really care about making a great first-impression to show customers that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll treat them for a lifetime.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Onboarding Express marking the inaugural success on the digital platform, our team has already begun working to improve other first-impression processes, like business banking and mortgage approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital banking platform connecting back end systems and opening up our ability to connect with APIs is what powers these types of solutions. Soon we&rsquo;ll be connecting our systems with external data like corporate registry information, digital document signing systems, and data storage platforms. Without the digital platform, it would have been nearly impossible to set up these sorts of integrations while maintaining a delightful customers experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we look at different ways to enhance the experience of banking, we&rsquo;re drawing inspiration not just from our own industry, but from the best apps, companies, and experiences out there. And most importantly, listening to Albertans about how they want to experience banking.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for a new bank account and you have five minutes to spare? Pop into any ATB branch and we&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ll leave a little bit happier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining the Customer Onboarding and Experience team eager to make banking work for people?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">Check out our open positions.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"21.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"customer-onboarding-in-the-era-of-apps-all-aboard-the-onboarding-express","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":44,"title":"From transaction to human interaction: UX powered rapid account opening","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/044/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:56","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<h2><strong>How can enterprise architecture transform UX and CX?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about the last time you opened a new bank account. You probably braced yourself to wait in a line or a waiting area; and if it was in the recent past, you made sure your smartphone was charged so you could scroll the news feed while answering procedural questions coming from someone immersed in their computer screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead and Google &ldquo;How long does it take to open a bank account?&rdquo; The answer varies from 30 minutes, to two days, to ten days. We&rsquo;re out to change this. And we&rsquo;re doing it by shifting our sights from corporate requirements to user and customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of getting our account opening process to under 4 minutes began with ATB Transformation team members spending &lsquo;a day in the life&rsquo; of frontline staff. What better way to uncovered pain points? As the &lsquo;First Encounter&rsquo; for ATB customers, account opening seemed like a fitting pilot to test new systems and break down barriers to human centred service delivery. With this goal in mind,&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>he team set out to move from &ldquo;how do you spell that?&rdquo; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s dream together&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>and see if they could meet a challenge put forth by our Chief Transformation Officer,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Wellington_ATB\" target=\"_blank\">Wellington Holbrook</a>&nbsp;to open a brand new account (including debit card in hand and Online Banking set up) in four minutes or less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain why the seemingly simple task of setting up a new account can be so complex, we have to lift the curtain a bit behind the complex workings and regulatory requirements of a Canadian Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the siloed corporate areas of a bank operated independently. For example, the risk and compliance side of the business has certain requirements for account opening. Then add a layer on top of that for opening a debit account. And another to apply for a credit card.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the old model, each siloed team has a different tool, screen, or form, and different information requirements. What happens typically is frontline team members are left to manage different systems and processes that don&rsquo;t work together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution that the Transformation Team created is built on a&nbsp;<strong>versatile digital platform that will help us elevate and integrate processes, making it easy to deliver best in class experiences</strong>. It streamlines the process for ATB frontline team members and&nbsp;<strong>overwhelmingly improves the account opening experience for ATB customers.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially what the new process looks like for customers and ATB team members is an easy scan of a driver&rsquo;s license, a few on-screen questions to answer, and then in the back-end, the system transforms the information into the right formats and makes service calls to underlying systems in our separate corporate areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The old process was built around the bank&rsquo;s and the regulator&rsquo;s requirements, with the customer experience coming second. The new one is built for user and customer experience first.&nbsp;</strong>It converts the &lsquo;transactional experience&rsquo; of the past to a more human interaction. For ATB, this means we&rsquo;re saving time and streamlining processes. But for our frontline staff, it means they can be dreaming with customers, not typing and re-typing information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A rapid account opening process means team members can spend more time learning about their customer&rsquo;s dreams and goals, and setting them on a path to happiness. Or it means we can help customers get in and out quickly, confident that they have the banking products that they need.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we&rsquo;re not just solving one problem at a time. The key to the solution is enterprise architecture, a new platform that sits on top of the underlying corporate structure and processes here at ATB. Our internal teams building off of the enterprise layer are now able to focus on building the best experience, rather than worrying out integrating processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re changing banking by focussing on the experience we want customers to have, and then applying technology to make that a reality. We&rsquo;re piloting this rapid process now, and already looking to apply the principal to improve experiences from mortgage lending to business banking.&nbsp;<strong>We want to find more ways to spend less time on the transaction, and more time on the human interaction.&nbsp;Are you interested in being part of meaningful projects just like this?

For example: increasing total deposits, creating cross-selling opportunities, acquiring new customer segments, or providing liquidity. The downside of challenger brands founded on the business need of a parent company is that they often come with a lack of inherent user-focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, independent challenger banks face a number of other obstacles - they may have a completely different operating model, and potentially lack a banking licence (which means that customers don&rsquo;t benefit from deposit insurance). Alternative models are often built specifically for a customer need and can involve pre-paid cards, creative product structuring, personal financial management tools, or great mobile applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A potential downside faced by independent challenger banks, particularly in North American markets, is a lack of trust, which can be an enormous barrier to customer acquisition in the banking sector. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, as we explore our own challenger brand, we are learning from both the institutional sub-brand model and the startup approach, looking to leverage the upside of each while avoiding mistakes and pitfalls. How do we build banking for the growing segment of the population who are &lsquo;digital natives,&rsquo; no matter their age, without being weighed down by assumptions about what &lsquo;banking&rsquo; is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than starting from scratch, we&rsquo;re coming in with the the power, experience, and resources of an established institution. In the founding of the Transformation Team at ATB, we&rsquo;ve harnessed the grit, passion, and agility of a startup, and now we&rsquo;re applying those skills and taking the best from both worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing a challenger brand is more of a &lsquo;mindset&rsquo; than a set process. For us, It is about tuning in to our customers to guide us; outsmarting, rather than outspending more traditional models; and creating a whole new game instead of playing by the old rules. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s quite a task we&rsquo;ve set for ourselves to transform banking, we look forward to finding like-minds to help set the new rules.

We are striving to identify customer problems and to respond to opportunities the moment a customer need arises. To achieve this, one of the research streams at the ATB AI Lab is geared towards building a real-time Artificial Intelligence system. With vast amounts of data, we need to distinguish signals from an ocean of noise, so we are using big data techniques to process incoming data streams and we&rsquo;re applying machine learning algorithms to extract informative behavioral signals. Make sure to subscribe to alphaBeta to get more details about &nbsp;the complex problems that our research teams are tackling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our partnership with UAlberta, we are able to invest resources into a flexible platform &nbsp;instead of a single-purpose solution, that enables collaboration and will help us build for tomorrow. Decentralization and modularity are core to this model, so we&rsquo;re creating an &ldquo;extensible platform&rdquo;: blended with architecture, language, and interfaces that will enable different components created by a team of researchers &nbsp;to co-exist and interact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re building an early prototype in a cloud-based infrastructure, focused on data storage, processing capability, machine learning algorithms, and APIs. Our microservices-oriented solution connects all the components of the system together, joining messaging buses, with mathematical models and databases to query data for real-time event detection. New components can be easily created and integrated into the overall system. The setup is like a &lsquo;social-network&rsquo; for different components, allowing them to interact, and accommodate each other without significant dependence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why does industry-academia partnership benefit from a microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with academic institutions provides a unique experience, in part because academic research tends to be horizontal in nature, with researchers working independently on different components of the system architecture. For the ATB AI Lab, building a microservices setup that is flexible, portable, and adaptable means that we can quickly change our tech stack when new challenges arise, without building an entirely new solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than working separately and trying to integrate technical pieces at an mature project stage, we can add and remove components, include different databases, data transformation pipelines, and predictive modeling modules to react quickly to make sure we are at the forefront in solving problems for our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why start with a prototype of the microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research partners are experts in their fields, but in some cases are not entirely familiar with banking. Launching a prototype phase gives teams a playground to get used to the types of data that we have and the types of problems we are solving in banking. It also provides us an opportunity to test the onboarding of new research teams and academic &nbsp;partners&mdash;a sort of training phase before the wheels come off for both us and our research partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to giving the researchers a sandbox, our in-house data science teams were able to see the immediate value of this prototype and are quickly deploying successful &nbsp;solutions based on proofs-of-concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we deepen our research partnership with UAlberta, we are excited to be building more than a single purpose technical solution - our aim is to have a system where components built by researchers, students, and ATB data scientists can interact seamlessly. With this system, we are translating the power of machine learning algorithms to applied banking solutions, to make banking better.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"24.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time","tags":[{"id":4,"title":"AI"},{"id":8,"title":"Machine Learning"}],"labs":[]},{"id":14,"title":"Challenger banks and embracing irrationality in banking","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/014/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 21:46","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Challenger banks (also known as neobanks or sometimes online-only banks) are pushing the traditional banking sector with novel solutions, user centric products, and impressive traction with customer acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them, challenger banks are independent companies or nimble brands under the umbrella of established financial institutions. They can be skunkworks operations targeting a new business model, customer segment, cost structure, brand, or strategy. They vary from startup companies providing a full range of banking services, to smaller, specialized brands with one or two specific offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard rumblings that ATB is launching a challenger bank. Well it is certainly true that we&rsquo;re always looking to challenge ourselves&mdash;and what better way to do that than to take a team of exceptional team members and set out to develop a standalone banking solution that creates better experiences for people in life, not just in banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;re focussed on challenging is the fundamental perspective that banks are meant to help people be responsible and rational with their money. Because banking is something that is done to you, not for you. We don&rsquo;t want to change people, we want to support who they are by providing banking services that are delightful, simple to use, and improve the experience of daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banking is a very rational dimension of life. However, what people feel about their money and finances exists on a separate plane, one that is driven more by emotion than rationality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we started looking at how we could challenge ourselves and the banking sector, we started out not just by looking at what other challenger banks are doing around the world, but we also took the time to stop and listen to what Albertans want. With over 600 one-on-one interviews and dozens of focus groups to-date, we&rsquo;ve uncovered valuable gems about what people want from banking products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we uncovered is that banking products are not necessarily broken. We don&rsquo;t have to entirely change how chequing accounts and credit cards work. We uncovered that people want digital offerings that help them do what they are already doing outside of banking. For example, vault accounts where people implement their own controls on how and when they can access their money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re serious about finding out how to make banking feel good, which is why we&rsquo;ve partnered with researchers from the University of Calgary to validate customer feedback on banking and user interfaces that create happiness and reduce stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of challenger banks is that they are not weighed down by legacy systems. In many cases, the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind processes and requirements in banking is like the pea at the bottom of a pile of mattresses. We&rsquo;re committed to peeling back to the fundamentals, breaking paradigms, and stepping out of the traditional perspective to embrace irrationality and the human aspects of finance and banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We want to open as many channels as possible for customers, so they can drive the experience, rather than saying &lsquo;here is the right thing to do with your money.&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put the power in the hands of our customers, we are building a flexible operating system based in the cloud and partnering with incredible companies like <a href=\"https://www.technisys.com/\">Technisys</a> out of Argentina and other top fintechs through API interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Albertans, at ATB we&rsquo;re not the type to sit back while the world changes around us. We&rsquo;re taking this challenge head on, getting our hands dirty to challenge ourselves, and banking. Can&rsquo;t wait to hear more?

But in reality, to run a business, hire staff, buy servers/equipment, rent an office, and pay utilities and taxes, every business needs at least some fiat currency. This means that <strong>cryptocurrency ventures in most cases still need to rely on business banking services from more traditional banking services providers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it can be challenging for cryptocurrency-focused ventures to find business banking services through traditional banks. This is particularly the case for up-and-coming Canadian crypto exchanges looking for business banking services here at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not without good reason that, historically, cryptocurrency has been taboo for banks. <strong>The anonymity and barriers to satisfying regulatory requirements that are the foundation of many currencies and exchanges often make traditional business banking off limits. </strong>Banks are built upon the tenets of knowing customers, avoiding money laundering, and minimizing financial and brand risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As blockchain technology becomes more integrated across sectors and cryptocurrencies take a growing place in the financial and business landscape, <strong>lack of knowledge, balancing needs of various customers, or fear may hinder more traditional financial institutions from taking part in this growing segment of the economy.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is not afraid of testing new waters, so we started the journey of exploring the risks and opportunities of cryptocurrency banking services. We started by carefully examining the different segments of the cryptocurrency space and identifying areas where ATB could feasibly work within regulatory compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we first explored the possibility of providing business banking services to firms operating in the cryptocurrency space, our traditional risk and compliance measures resulted in a big &lsquo;NO&rsquo;. This provided us with an exceptional opportunity to look again at our systems to see how we might be able to get to a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Working directly with our in-house experts, we made the big first step of identifying KYC (Know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money-laundering) thresholds that would have to be met in order for a business to qualify for business banking with ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crossing the threshold of banking with a cryptocurrency based business would be a big thing for a traditional institution like ATB.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a perfect fit for ATB to lead the way on business banking for eligible cryptocurrency businesses in Alberta. We see benefits for ATB, our clients, and for the overall economy. For our eighty-year history, we have been dedicated to transforming quickly to support Albertans as they build businesses in an ecosystem known for innovation, entrepreneurship, and calculated risk taking. ATB understands that different business sectors have different banking needs, they don&rsquo;t all fit in the same box. We&rsquo;ve done it before with <a href=\"http://www.atb.com/business/experts/arts-and-culture-branch/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">business banking for Arts and Culture</a> and now we&rsquo;re learning how we can support cryptocurrency business with banking services..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will be part of the future.

This means having organizational infra</strong><strong>structure that sets us apart with speed and agility, helping us bring smart ideas to life quickly.</strong>&nbsp;In 2017, we took a hard look at our processes and infrastructure, including our &lsquo;reuse, buy, build&rsquo; hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our investigation, we were reminded that buying a product can have some serious pitfalls. Though often commended for being the cheaper and quicker option, going with an off-the-shelf software has risks of incompatibility and limits in functionality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customizations can also lead to nightmares when new versions are released. We dare you to find an IT manager who doesn&rsquo;t have a story to tell about getting so deep into customizations that a simple update can mean a system (and mental) meltdown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ve flipped the model on its head, moving &lsquo;build&rsquo; above &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. The build-first model requires an up-front investment that can prove challenging for many organizations. It also means that tools can take a little bit longer to get into the hands of team members, but the time and human resources investment can pay off big.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So why go the custom-built software route? It comes down to customization and growth.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key to success with the new hierarchy is a team equipped with the skills and technology stack to feasibly build solutions. At ATB we&rsquo;ve got the talent pool and the same technology stack as the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first foray was to build the ATB Digital Platform that powers our rapid account opening process. The platform is the &lsquo;plumbing&rsquo; of a scalable system that overlays ATB&rsquo;s legacy infrastructure, creating a custom platform that is easier to scale to other systems and processes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we had the plumbing in place, we brought a group of ATB developers into the lab and trained them up on the tools that underlay the Digital Platform. Now we have a team of developers who are able to quickly scale custom solutions to problems faced by our internal teams and ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building the software ourselves means features are fully customized and not at the mercy of version updates.&nbsp;</strong>We are able to adapt the ATB Digital Platform quickly in response to changing needs. Building from scratch allows for the programs to grow with us, and the investment is scalable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buying a product might work for what we need right now, but what about five years down the road? A forward-thinking mindset eliminates future frustrations of working with lagging technology or, worse, being bogged down by updating and testing customizations or being forced to transfer everything over to a new system in a few years time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transformation Team at ATB has catalyzed many positive iterations in how we do our work. Our organization structure is now structured for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">customer experience-based design;</a> our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">teams are inclusive</a>; the way we design is built for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way/\">speed and agility</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way\">.</a> In the name of innovation, we&rsquo;re not afraid to veto stale paradigms and provide meaningful solutions to problems large and small. For now, that means reuse, build, then buy; but we&rsquo;re open to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like what you hear?

Normally renaming an internal department is not a newsworthy event, but as our traditional IT department became anything <strong>but</strong> traditional, the transitioned from &ldquo;IT Service Delivery&rdquo; to &ldquo;Technology Enablement&rdquo; reflected more than just a name change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change reflects a different approach to providing foundational IT systems and support. Our Technology Enablement team is the &lsquo;engine room,&rsquo; keeping the lights on and the systems powered so that team members can &nbsp;make enormous leaps like implementing <a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/reuse-buy-or-build-new-answers-to-old-questions-in-software-and-tech\">robotics process optimization</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/11\">,</a> <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">cloud deployments of the most advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">,</a> and <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/19\">microservices architecture for more flexible collaborative work environments</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are making huge changes as the entire organization moves towards agile methodology and the cloud, the tools and principles that we apply in Technology Enablement vary slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in Agile methodology, a Scrum team is very disciplined with a very focused goal. The &lsquo;fires&rsquo; that can arise in traditional IT can cause a huge distraction to a Scrum team. That&rsquo;s why we are taking care of all those fires so that IT teams in other departments can run disciplined Scrums without worrying about the underlying systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So rather than implementing full Scrum methodology, we use the agile mindset and apply the principles across our enterprise systems. We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of carving off dedicated team members, or ignoring fires, but we do have the principles of agile development that we can apply in a more traditional IT environment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key principles we have adopted is the automation of repetitive testing and regular checks of our core systems, freeing up team resources that used to be dedicated to continual testing of core systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discrete workflows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another principle we have adopted from agile development is breaking work into discrete pieces rather than massive upgrades or changes. Compartmentalizing changes allows us to allocate resources more effectively, knowing the &lsquo;steps&rsquo; means that we can pull team members off projects without disrupting entire processes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ceremonies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many agile methodologies have very specific ceremonies, like sprint planning meetings, retrospectives and standups. Many of these ceremonies are extremely effective for project communication, prioritization, and optimization workflow. Even without adopting the full agile methodology, many of the ceremonies of agile development prove effective for teams in traditional IT environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the big changes in our transformation at ATB has been moving to the cloud and to fully integrate systems. This transition is both a blessing and a curse for IT managers. Integration means things are connected, but the downside is that there can be dramatic ripple effects of changes especially as it relates to the taking advantage of the new techniques and features of cloud platforms. In the traditional IT space of running big, bulky systems, we have the added challenge of adopting the key principles of the agile mindset, while making sure that we are alleviating some of the curses of legacy large scale integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since traditional IT success is measured against availability, reliability, and security, we take a different mindset to agile development to compensate for the added downside risk of service interruption or failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we take pride in the fact that we are far ahead of many in the banking sector globally. Moving from mainframe systems years before many other large financial institutions. Our job in Technology Enablement is to make sure that the legacy and core systems are available, reliable, and secure, while providing ATB transformation team members advanced tools, technology, and power to live up to our mission of transforming the lives of Albertans through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is about making your time richer. Our customer obsession infiltrates the entire organization. Our front end staff want to make our customers time richer. Our transformation team wants our front end staff to have the tools to provide the best service to customers. And, whatever name they go by, our Tech Enablement team wants to ensure that Transformation team members can spend their time where it is most valuable, with stable and reliable technology behind them.

In one sprint we can dedicate resources to optimizing the user experience, while the next is dedicated to implementing new product features. From simple bug fixes to launching digital products through new distribution channels, product managers must constantly weigh business and user needs to allocate resources towards the optimal vectors of improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks in part to this optimized development process, user interfaces have experienced massive evolution (think of the transition from typing commands, to mouse clicks, to touch screens), conversational user interfaces (UI) like virtual chatbots and voice assistants are beginning to rise up as the technology of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve previously shared details from the product team behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ATBFinancial/\">ATB&rsquo;s virtual assistant&nbsp;</a>in Facebook Messenger, including their<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/product-development-in-the-era-of-decay-of-delight\">&nbsp;fondness for &lsquo;decay of delight&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;that drives product improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re giving a sneak peak at how they are taking their passion, learnings, and experimentation to be ahead of the curve with natural language processing and the user interfaces of the future. Check out some of the vectors of improvement where the team is creating business and customer value with conversational UI, starting with the ATB virtual assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 1 - UX improvements: mapping natural language to intent</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is one thing to train humans to input commands that a computer understands. It is a completely other process to teach a computer to map natural human language inputs to intent.&nbsp;</strong>That is the first layer for our approach to conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving the user experience provides customers the solution to their problems with as little friction as possible. Improving confidence levels and increasing the scope of utterances is the key way to reduce friction for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From learning all the different ways that someone may ask for their account balance, to increasing the number of tasks that can be performed autonomously, every challenging question that a customer asks is an opportunity for us to learn and improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try asking any voice assistant or chatbot what the exchange rate is right now, you&rsquo;ll likely get a response, but it might not be the exact form you were looking for. From early users, we took this learning and improved the way the ATB virtual assistant responds. Now you&rsquo;ll get options for CAD to USD, USD to CAD, or links to other exchange rates. Making sure that users get the answers they are looking for, not frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 2 - Integrations for task completion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Following mapping an utterance to intent, the next layer in conversational UI is to perform an action based on the identified intent.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, it is crucial to integrate back end systems so that tasks can be performed autonomously. If Alexa is not paired to your phone, you won&rsquo;t get the song you requested. If Siri can&rsquo;t activate your messenger app, it will be hard to use voice to text your mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got strong collaboration between our internal data teams to provide the needed back end integration. That has also allowed us to provide features like push notifications with proactive and personalized notifications to customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Can you imagine if your cell phone provider proactively called you to tell you that there was a plan that would meet all of your needs and save you money? Probably doesn&rsquo;t happen now for most of us...what if ATB could do that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now testing a feature in the ATB virtual assistant that will track customers&rsquo; recent account fees and transactions, and will notify them if they could have saved money on fees using a different type of account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With conversational UI optimized for natural language processing and tied into back-end systems, the future is bright for creating frictionless banking experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 3 - Optichannel experiences to support conversational UI adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before on alphaBeta about our commitment to providing exceptional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/37\">optichannel</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optichannel-not-omnichannel\">&nbsp;</a>experiences, where customers can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As users become more accustomed to the capabilities and limitations of voice and text interactions, optichannel remains a crucially important vector of improvement for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are striving for seamless optichannel experiences through a feature that allows customers to move from the AI based chat to a customer care agent within Facebook Messenger. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we work on expanding the tasks that can be autonomously completed, there are still instances where customers need to connect with an ATB team member. So if someone is chatting and they are faced with a problem that the bot can&rsquo;t complete - the bot can now connect them directly to a customer care agent who can authenticate the customer within the chat and provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recognize that dedicating development resources to maintain optichannel integrations will remain an important factor in adoption rate of conversational UI and we are optimizing our development time accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 4 - New channel implementation: the magic of channel-agnostic conversational UI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversational UI is fairly channel-agnostic. You&rsquo;ll talk the same way with a voice assistance through your smart-watch, phone, or desktop computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ATB virtual assistant, that means that the learnings we draw from our integration with Facebook Messenger can be easily rolled out across other channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the chief benefits of the ATB virtual assistant when we launched was having Facebook Messenger as the channel. ATB customers were able to connect with their bank in the same channel where they connect with family and friends. Our aim was to help people integrate positive financial habit building into a channel that they were already using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That channel was just a start for our conversational UI. Internally, we are working with a virtual-assistant-as-a-service model to deploy the user experience into different ATB properties. We have the capabilities to integrate the bot into channels such as the ATB website or our own mobile application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our development resources are dedicated to the vectors of improvement that will provide value to ATB customers. With the ATB virtual assistant, we&rsquo;re improving mappings of natural language to increase the scope of tasks that can be undertaken by the bot. We&rsquo;re making sure there is seamless optichannel integration and rolling out conversational UI into multiple channels to help integrate the banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much work to be done in fintech and across sectors in the capabilities and adoption of conversational UI, but we see its potential to greatly reduce friction in banking and an almost unlimited number of uses cases. We&rsquo;ll continue to work across vectors of improvement to create happiness through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining the Transformation team and working on reducing friction in banking through conversational UI?&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/#divisions\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open positions</a></strong>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"29.05.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"vectors-of-improvement-for-conversational-user-interfaces","tags":[],"labs":[]},{"id":9,"title":"‘Partnership’ is the new best practice in vendor relationship management","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/009/ATB-AlphaBeta-Client_Vendor-FINAL.gif","date":"23.10.2018 21:24","facets":["connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>The world is swimming with technology applications that are made to solve problems that large companies face. For organizations, the holy grail is often to crack into the &lsquo;corporate client&rsquo; market. Whether it is enterprise software with long sales cycles and fully customized deployment, or a bottom-up effort getting individual staff members to push for company adoption of tools such as Dropbox or Slack&mdash;the key to success for many organizations is getting corporate buy-in and adoption of paid service offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not all corporate clients are equally attractive for vendors, especially those working in emerging spaces or applying new technologies in more traditional sectors, like banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recently had great success working with SAS on the <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">world&rsquo;s first large-scale full production deployment</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\"> </a>of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud. Our eagerness to listen and learn doesn&rsquo;t stop with ATB customers, so we sat down with the project team to hear what made this project so successful and what makes a great client-vendor partnerships with the types of innovative technology companies that we&rsquo;re eager to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing we noticed when sitting down with the team was how tough it was to spot who works for ATB and who works for the vendor. From SAS, &ldquo;the greatest compliment we can get is to sit down with an executive team and have them think that we are in-house staff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we figured out who works where, we dug into the details to find out how the ATB + SAS Viya deployment team eschewed the vendor-client relationship to build a collaborative partnership. Here are a few of the things they shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Get organization-wide buy in. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is not enough for the direct client area to be great at collaborating with vendors. For institutions like ATB, deploying any type of new software or program requires buy-in and collaboration from many different business areas. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though there were some risks in undertaking an un-tried deployment of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud, the project had strong support, not only from executive and project teams, but also procurement, finance, and legal. This was crucial to successful launch and keeping the project on schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Nothing beats face-to-face. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, electronic communications are fast and efficient, but building personal relationships and getting key parties in one room for important brainstorming or decision making can make or break a project. For the SAS Viya deployment, project members from Google, Hortonworks, SAS, and ATB gathered in Edmonton for brainstorming and project planning at the outset. Throughout the project, morning standups via video conference made sure that all parties were in the loop, with open lines of communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of in-person workshops allowed the multi-party project to work through issues like risk identification, security requirements, and optimizing network performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Start with trust. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our partnerships with vendors are more like a marriage than a sales transaction. And just like in a successful marriage, both parties need to be committed to giving trust freely, and earning it continuously. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve learned the hard way not to give specifications to a vendor and to blindly trust that they will deliver. But those challenging relationships haven&rsquo;t stopped us from giving trust where it is deserved. Trust means not jumping to contract terms and fighting to be right, but working through problems to find a common solution. Trust means being upfront about intentions and providing clear and continuous feedback about what is going well and what is not. Trust sometimes means forgiving mistakes and working to improve together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t just sell, solve. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because a tech startup got face time with a corporate client, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is a good fit. Both parties can suffer when there is misalignment between the client needs (or what they think they need) and what the vendor intends to design, or what they think the market needs. For a tech startup, landing a huge corporate client and then finding out that what they want requires a custom-build, or differs from where the product was headed, can derail future growth potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly on the client side, putting time and money into a technology solution that doesn&rsquo;t fit the exact use-case can be a setback at best, or detrimental at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With SAS, we dug into the use-case very deeply and found fundamental alignment to explore the new area of deploying SAS Viya entirely in the cloud. Together, we architected the solution, working on every piece of hardware being installed, the specs, the software, and configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the first step was making sure that we had alignment between the client-problem and the vendor solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ask the right questions. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we are working with a new vendor, there are some very telling questions that indicate whether it is going to be a great partnership. Here are just a few of the questions we love to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can you tell me about a time you <em>successfully</em> worked with a vendor my size?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can we send a staff member to work out of your office?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can I call you unannounced?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>How can I help you succeed? What other solutions have you tried?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we strive to be the type of client that vendors dream of partnering with. Our teams are made up of passionate people, working on exciting projects to leverage data and change our business operations with the ultimate goal of making our customers happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not just picking a product to buy, we&rsquo;re choosing life-long partners and aligning ourselves with people. Both the client and vendor are better off working in partnership; the <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">evidence is clear</a> that we can achieve more in architecting solutions together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like our partnership with our customers to help them create happiness in their lives, we look to partner with vendors who understand why we care and share our passion, determination, and commitment to creating value.

It is a tightrope to walk in terms of timing and product readiness to ensure a successful MVP rollout and long term adoption of a successful product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, we ran our <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/customer-onboarding-in-the-era-of-apps-all-aboard-the-onboarding-express\">first prototype of an internal tool built on our digital platform.</a> But when we launched the MVP version of of Onboarding Express, it was far from completely perfect (as any MVP normally is). Here are a few of reasons why we are working with a &lsquo;roll-out-now&rsquo; mentality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Value &gt; Perfection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If there is an iota of immediate value created by the MVP version of the product, there is an opportunity cost to holding it back to a later stage&mdash;why wait when you could be creating value, solving a problem, or selling a product now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When our product team spent &lsquo;a-day-in-the-life&rsquo; with ATB team members in branches. We saw the urgent need to change the account opening process. Between the burden on staff of holding up a conversation while navigating multiple interfaces and the missed opportunity to add value with a brand new ATB customer, this was an urgent problem that needed to be solved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">With our new digital platform, it was the perfect time to prototype. Luckily, our in-branch partners saw the potential and were eager to test an MVP even through the initial bumps. For Onboarding express, the early roll-out validated that we were moving in the right direction and allowed us to collect feedback and make functionality fixes that meant better interactions and more smiles on the faces of both ATB staff and our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If it can start making team members and customers lives better today, we should put it in the hands of team members now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Phase-two never comes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Have you ever worked on a service or product roll out that had an elaborate plan for &lsquo;phase-two,&rsquo; but that second phase never came? That is one of the risks of rolling out a product that is nearly ready. If functionality is far enough along and value is being delivered, it is too easy to pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next big challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Rolling out while things are still clunky or broken means you have to keep working on it. Baby steps take much less momentum than jumping across a gaping crevasse, so it&rsquo;s easier to keep a project moving continually forward, with less risk that we might fall in or get distracted before taking off. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The early roll out not only pushed us to quickly improve functionality, but it also enabled us to incorporate important learnings that we might otherwise have missed. Things like loosening the character limits on the user names and increasing the time window to activate a debit card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We&rsquo;re still working on improving Onboarding Express, but somehow the crevasse is behind us and we&rsquo;re still moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>It builds a culture of adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Across the ATB Transformation team and the entire organization, we&rsquo;re building a <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/fostering-a-culture-of-adoption\">culture of adoption</a>. That means team members are eager and willing to take up new tools and technology. They&rsquo;re willing to join in the building process because they share the belief that we&rsquo;re making positive changes that will create value for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Just like any muscle, we need to be constantly exercising our adoption abilities, building our strength. One of the critical factors of success when launching an early MVP is setting expectations. If users are expecting it to be perfect, they will be disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Part of our adoption process at ATB is inviting early users along on the journey, leveraging our internal communities, and creating excitement and open discussion around launch. Instead of rolling out a new tool to staff members who feel burdened, they are part the team building it and their feedback is heard and incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Our <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/52\">Spark</a> team and internal communication team members were the catalysts, the engines, you might say, behind the success of Onboarding Express, keeping the lines of communication open and building momentum for roll-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our mission is huge: to elevate the human experience and create happiness through banking. We know that if we aim for perfection, we may never get there.

Sometimes the design is purely aesthetic: &ldquo;Our website is out of date, let&rsquo;s design a new one.&rdquo; Other times, the design changes are founded in the user experience. These are the types of changes that customers relish, instead of shun. Not just new fonts, colours, and templates, but transformed digital experiences that are faster and more delightful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of our new digital business banking experience starts with our own internal transformation into a customer obsessed organization with an agile mindset. In our customer obsession, we uncovered that approximately half of our business customers use digital banking tools weekly, and a quarter of them daily. On average, business banking customers spend one hour per week with us across all of our digital banking tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the primary touchpoint that business banking customers have with ATB, we embarked on a mission to uncover how we can live up to our story and show our customer obsession through the digital business banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our business banking customers agree: banking should enable business, not slow it down. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to take that hour per week and make sure that customers leave knowing that we are listening to their needs, that we value their time, and that we are committed to providing the best possible digital experience, not one that is just &lsquo;good enough&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From listening to our customers, we uncovered a few areas where our business banking services were missing the mark. For example, one of the first tools we are testing is removing unnecessary friction in the controls over business banking accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not every business is built the same, so why should business banking controls all be alike? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of limited options for varying user permissions and approvals, we want to give our business banking customers customization and flexibility to make sure that their banking procedures fit the needs of their business. Want to give an employee permission to pay bills, from certain accounts, up to a certain amount or daily limit, to certain payees, only requiring approvals if they need to exceed their limit? You should be able to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of new tools that fit the needs of business banking customers is account nicknames. We noticed that some business customers were creating account nicknames to sort their accounts based on business function or geography. Want to be able to group your accounts to see just the Edmonton office? We want to help you do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers don&rsquo;t necessarily care what a website looks like, but in fact the design underpins the two things that users do care about: How quickly can I satisfy my need? And how does the experience make me feel?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why we are committed to ensuring that core banking needs of customers are met. Only once their fundamental banking needs are met and trust and transparency are established can we look to empower them and bring happiness to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Alberta businesses, we are doing things in new ways because we know it will lead to a better outcome. With a growth mindset, we can all get there faster.

They&rsquo;re not usually crossing their fingers that users won&rsquo;t even notice a release or update. So maybe we&rsquo;re a bit of a different breed, because we revel in the decay of customer delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring many different technology solutions to customer problems, including<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">&nbsp;augmenting customer service with Pepper the robot</a>&nbsp;and exploring how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/34\">artificial intelligence (AI) can help make banking better</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/does-the-world-need-another-ai-lab\">.</a> In 2017, we also launched our virtual banking assistant in Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The virtual assistant is an AI-powered consumer facing experience that allows a customer to type in natural language and receive an answer back from the bot. More than just a technology play or flashy product, with the virtual assistant, we aimed to solve a crucial customer problem. People want consistency in service and answers. And they want twenty-four hour access. We were able to provide just that, in a channel that customers can fully control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many users, the first time they interact with a bot, the novelty is delightful, as they engage in natural conversation with a machine and are amazed when it provides answers or completes a task. Think of your friend showing you they can turn the lights on and off with a verbal request or change the thermostat without moving a muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our desire is to deliver this kind of gratifying experience to customers, but we also recognize that when users interact with the virtual assistant, they want to feel as though they are in a conversation with their bank.&nbsp;</strong>This comes along with high expectations of what the virtual assistant can accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each interaction, the AI-powered chatbot is processing and understanding, using machine learning techniques to get better over time. The end promise is that each time you use it, you are contributing to it getting smarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest barriers to improvement is getting users to push the system to the limit. We are actually not hitting the edge enough. When people feel the delight of a novel product, or the frustration when it can&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, they are less likely to push the extreme boundary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we dig deeper into natural language processing and how humans interact with robots, we have developed a deep fondness for the natural decay of delight as people become more accustomed to what bots can do.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want people to constantly increase their expectations of the capabilities of a bot, as odd as that may sound, because it pushes us to continually improve and build new capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As market leaders, we have this great problem of being at the forefront of people&rsquo;s expectations. We can give them everything they want, then they&rsquo;ll want a bit more. That is what drives us forward. We are constantly discovering, and solving, new challenges - which is the most exciting part of what we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a product team, we&rsquo;ll always work on what has the most customer impact. Business value is customer value. Sometimes that means we&rsquo;re shipping brand new features. Sometimes it is simply: &lsquo;here is a fast stable product that you can trust to work&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Updates are not always announcement worthy, but that is actually the goal; people may not notice, remark, or comment, but we want them to have that increase in expectations and decay in delight, because it means we get to keep making the product better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the virtual assistant, we aimed to provide core customer and business value. And by no means are we done. The Facebook Messenger virtual assistant was a direct result of research and listening, with an ideal confluence of our internal capabilities, a great partner in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finn.ai/\">Finn.ai</a>, and the right channel with which to integrate. We are continuing to explore the many vectors and areas where we can make the experience better and applying our learnings to other high-value services for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you, like us, revel in the decay of customer delight.

With an engineering degree and analytical mindset, she has had a hand in prototyping early neural networks for speech recognition at Nortel, supporting Shaw&rsquo;s analog to digital conversion in television, and leading transformation strategy for the technology team at Enbridge as their Chief Technology Officer. She is also the proud owner of seven patents with the USPTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through her impressive career track record and technical background, one of the most pivotal moments for her was becoming a parent. &ldquo;My family makes me a stronger leader, and what I do in my career and in my work makes me a better mom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she is not changing the world through technology, Denise spends as much time as possible drawing inspiration from her children and spending time with family, where she still exercises her scientific side through her love of baking. &ldquo;I find baking quite cathartic. Measuring, cooking, enjoying the tastes and smells.&rdquo; And, just like how the science behind &nbsp;technology is not as meaningful or transformative without the people, sharing baking with friends and family is what really matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise says, &ldquo;being a parent really brought together the analytical and human aspects of technology for me. Technology is a science project, but transformation is about culture. A trusting, safe, open, and transparent environment is critical for true transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At ATB, I see an environment that is embracing experimentation. That made me really curious, and made me want to be a part of it. I want to be a part of the excitement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is not afraid of making bold changes. After several years working at the forefront of intellectual property licensing for technology patents, Denise made a mid-career decision to go to law school. Partially to satisfy her thirst for knowledge, for Denise, &ldquo;going back to school later in life was an opportunity to see the world through a different lens. It really reinforced my love of technology and helped me think differently to see the world from different angles. It made me a stronger technologist. It also made me learn to read a lot faster!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is excited to bring her bold fearlessness and curiosity to lead ATB&rsquo;s digital team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are experiencing a perfect storm that is enabling disruptive technology. In Alberta, ATB is really at the forefront. It is incredible that we can drive digital transformation to serve Albertans with modern, agile financial services that were previously unimagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Banking is so personal. Everybody&rsquo;s needs around finances are varied. As ATB unlocks this data, we are able to provide unique, personal experiences that meet the needs of individuals. That is really monumental. Not many companies have embraced it to the level and degree that ATB has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than the opportunities for technological advancement, one of the biggest things that drives Denise is the ambition to leave a legacy and a better world for her children and for the next generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest things that drew me to ATB is the genuine desire to make a difference in Alberta and to build a strong, diversified, inclusive economy. Having seen the impact on people and families of economic downturns, I never want to see Albertans face that type of challenge again. If I can make a difference in that, that is very important for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is about growing talent, bringing diversity to our economy, ensuring that people have a livelihood through their banking and through their financial profile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her work in technology and transformation, Denise draws plenty from time spent with family. &ldquo;Kids today are growing up digital. I remember when I realized things were really switching when my one-year-old started trying to swipe the TV. She couldn&rsquo;t speak, but the whole world to her was digital, mobile, tactile. She thought everything worked that way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we&rsquo;re excited to grow along with the digital generation and find ways that technology can make positive change for Albertans. With Denise guiding our digital teams, we&rsquo;re in good hands.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"07.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"introducing-denise-man-leading-digital-transformation-inspired-by-the-next-generation-of-albertans","tags":[{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":22,"title":"Balancing model accuracy and explainability of machine learning models","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/022/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 20:00","facets":["progress","business","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>In early 2018, a team of ATB data scientists<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">&nbsp;competed&nbsp;</a>against some of the top teams in the world in a predictive analytics Kaggle competition. For the team competing, although there are many differences between applying their skills in competition versus their everyday work, there were incredible learnings to be had. Our team was able to explore methodologies, test a broad selection of feature engineering strategies, and try applications of high efficiency models like Light GBM and XGBoost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are key differences between professional application of data science and participating in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">Kaggle</a><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\">&nbsp;</a>data science competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Kaggle competition:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n\t<li>The focus is to win the competition by building a highly predictive model. In real life, the goal is to get useful results that can be interpreted and acted on;</li>\r\n\t<li>Success is measured by ranking criteria such as AUC (area under the curve) score. In life, predictive models have real-world impacts, consequences, and both quantitative and qualitative value assessment;</li>\r\n\t<li>Any technique that increases accuracy is fair, even if the final model cannot be explained fully. In life, it is crucial to understand the input features and their interactions in a predictive model to ensure that the model is robust, compliant, and can be trusted; and</li>\r\n\t<li>The jump from 96.83 per cent accuracy to 97.85 might put you in the the top 5% of competitors. In life, 85 per cent accuracy might be the target model fit, based on many different factors to weigh, including ease of model deployment and management.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In banking, we are impacting people&rsquo;s lives. So it is not just about putting the model into production that has the highest accuracy. Equally important, we must make sure that whatever we are proceeding with will work to the benefit of our customers and Albertans: ethics, transparency, and compliance are pivotal model design paradigms.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While high efficiency models can be exciting and beneficial, the availability of elastic compute engines and black box solutions puts additional scrutiny on data scientists to ensure that the models that are being used to make important decisions have been thoroughly validated. Interpretability increases in importance when applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in a Kaggle competition, ensemble modeling is a commonly used technique that can provide huge lift in accuracy of a predictive model. However, if applied in a real-life setting, we would need to apply techniques to ensure the model is explainable, including continuous validation &nbsp;and quality assurance so we are sure that we are impacting our customers lives in a positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of competing in a Kaggle competition is the opportunity to expose ourselves to new thoughts and ideas. Both in the application of algorithms, but also to expand our understanding of the impact of AI on the world. That is why one of the focus areas of &nbsp;ATB&rsquo;s&nbsp;AI Lab, launched in April 2018, is the ethical application of AI for people and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI Lab also builds on our learnings about the value of bringing together diverse thinkers. We are working with professors and graduate students from the&nbsp;University of Alberta&nbsp;across the fields of Math, Science, and Economics to help find the best solutions to customer problems at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way that great breakthroughs can be achieved in a Kaggle competitions by leveraging team members with diverse backgrounds and applying newer techniques and strategies, in real-life we are bringing theoretical research powered by a team from various &nbsp;disciplines into production at our AI lab. The diversity of thought is what leads to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re excited to continue our exploration of AI-powered future while remaining keenly aware of the dichotomy between the blind pursuit of model accuracy and the importance of keeping human ethics at the center of model design.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in joining us as we work towards building an AI-powered future grounded in ethics?

We&rsquo;ve changed the way&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAnHzDEP8GM\" target=\"_blank\">international money transfers</a>&nbsp;leverage Blockchain. Now, we&rsquo;re building systems for maintaining identity records. But we like to keep it in the community, so we&rsquo;re also using Blockchain to tackle a very Albertan topic&hellip; Oil Settlement Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, Oil Settlement Day was a very cinematic occasion. All the head honchos of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their chequebooks in tow, ready to settle their scores. It sounds like something out of the Wild West, right? The stakes were definitely high and the dollars (and maybe the ale, too) would flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil Settlement Day has since moved into the electronic world, but things aren&rsquo;t working as efficiently as they should. Right now, Oil Settlement Day is a drawn out process that starts a couple weeks before the 25th, with all sorts of reconciling and approvals that must happen so that funds can move on the big day. When the time comes, lots of the smaller companies need to wait for funds to arrive before they can settle their own contracts, so rather than a slick series of transactions, Oil Settlement Day is currently a bit of a clunky muddle. Within ATB, we have a group of employees who manually enter our system to process contract payments and make the money move. So for the oil companies&mdash;and for us&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is at a premium, and we know there&rsquo;s a better way to do this. One that marries trust with immediacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve developed a Blockchain proof of concept with the help of IBM that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including oil companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly. No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re testing the waters with this new and improved settlement process, but one thing is certain: this could have a huge, positive impact both on the oil industry in Alberta (and beyond) and on ATB. It could save time (and therefore money) for our clients, free up some of our staff for more meaningful work, and provide us with a groundbreaking new economic opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB we&#39;re always looking for talent to be part of meaningful projects just like this one.

In general, technologies further out on the horizon have riskier adoption prospects, higher technological challenges, and are riskier capital investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a consumer, it can be exciting to get the first release of a product or software, but it often comes at the risk of it not functioning perfectly, or a better model coming out shortly after.&nbsp;<strong>As a first-mover, you&rsquo;re taking on higher risk, with the hopes that the rewards will be greater.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an innovation focussed organization, we also have to be strategic about investing our time and resources in technologies that will have a real impact on our customers and our bottom line.

While investments in horizon-one technology are fairly safe in terms of demand, they are also highly competitive, as there is widespread market adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Machine learning today is a horizon-one technology. There are out-of-the-box solutions and there is high assuredness of demand for machine learning technology. However, applications of machine learning can take us into horizon-two or three. For example, at ATB we&rsquo;re exploring machine learning applied to natural language processing and robotics processing automation with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\" target=\"_blank\">Pepper</a>, our customer service robot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon-two</strong>&nbsp;is a bit further out on the technology curve, with about 60 per cent market assuredness. So you&rsquo;re pretty sure that it&rsquo;s coming and there is a market need, but there might be some technological barriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">An example of horizon two technology is voice interaction applied to home voice assistants. There has been significant uptake in the adoption of the hardware by first movers and the early majority but there are still some barriers to integration, kinks in the technology, and less than sure majority acceptance as we move down the technology adoption curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon three</strong>&nbsp;technologies are about the five-year out mark. There are likely high technological barriers and low assurance that the market will adopt the technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Imagine something that seems almost sci-fi now that could be part of everyday life in the not so distant future (think a few years back to what you thought of artificial intelligence or self driving cars). Looking forward, we could see implants taking over as the next phase of wearable tech and quantum computing revolutionizing encryption and the power of data analysis through machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finding the balance between investment across the three horizon technologies is crucial for any business that wants to keep up with the pace of technological change.&nbsp;</strong>As traditional banks compete with fintechs and with companies like Amazon and Apple making forays into finance and banking, it is more important than ever for us to be exploring all three horizons. When the next technological rocket explodes, we&rsquo;ll be at the helm, steering it to uncharted territories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think you can keep up with the pace?

We have previously shared our<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JD7tSGF6ulUQx3qWAlMyE3-HnuXixOz19CEp57u5-w4/edit?ts=5af9a6d8\">&nbsp;excitement</a>&nbsp;at being at the forefront with our virtual assistant chatbot powered by AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our team developing the ATB virtual assistant, applying machine learning techniques to improve natural language processing is a foundational effort. Incredible by-products of that effort have been the discoveries around how people interact with the chatbot on a human level, providing learnings that are transferable across user experience design problems we are working to solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of those learnings is that the chatbot has the intrinsic ability to increase the discoverability of the solutions our customers are asking for. The chatbot is able to break down barriers by providing a safe environment for customers to ask questions that can help increase their financial well-being.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain how a chatbot does this, consider, have you ever felt embarrassed to ask a question about mortgage terminology? Or looked for information online on how to change your debit card limits? It is human nature to feel self-conscious when one feels unaware or out of their depth. But people are often happy to ask these kinds of questions to a chatbot, when they also trust it to understanding what they are asking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another aspect to this &#39;discoverability problem&#39; is that customers don&rsquo;t always know exactly what they need or how to ask for it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of natural language processing (NLP) within the ATB virtual assistant addresses this problem directly. Think of the chatbot&#39;s NLP abilities as a patient and observant partner, truly listening and responding to the intention behind words rather than the words themselves. This act of listening to true intention is core to the virtual assistant and helps people discover the truth that they are looking for, in a comfortable way. Start with listening, layer in machine learning, and you will find a recipe for creating trust and engagement with users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of supervised machine learning creates a positive feedback loop, where the NLP capabilities of the virtual assistant are constantly improving. Users themselves are constantly teaching the chatbot; each utterance contributes to its growing abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does it really mean when we talk about truly listening to a customer&#39;s intention and not just their words? Maybe someone gives an utterance, &quot;Hey, I lost my credit card, what do I do?&quot; As individuals, we read this and say, &#39;we should help this customer make sure their card is safe.&#39; In its own way the chatbot does the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great example of the end-to-end experience, as the chatbot can&#39;t simply hear you, but is also capable of responding and helping. Our teams work on both sides of the experience, augmenting the chatbot&rsquo;s NLP capabilities as well as deepening its connections to core ATB systems. Facilitating deeper, more data-driven, and personalized responses. The first iteration of a response may be simple content. If customers validate the importance of that response with their usage and feedback, the chatbot learns, allowing for stronger mappings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; guiding the ATB virtual assistant is our commitment to helping people discover the solutions they need, when they need them. Stay tuned to alphaBeta for more details about upcoming feature releases for the chatbot and how we&rsquo;re applying our learnings in user experience design to new channels.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"08.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"ux-learnings-from-atb-s-ai-powered-virtual-financial-assistant-chatbot","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"}],"labs":[]},{"id":48,"title":"Shipping experiences the lean startup way.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/048/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:02","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;re always looking for efficiency and process improvements, I mean, who isn&rsquo;t? One thing that we have embraced well here at ATB is the lean startup method as one of the many tools that can be borrowed from the startup world to bring efficiency to how we roll out new solutions and experiences, big and small. After all, it&rsquo;s not about the size of the solution, but the overall impact to the experience. Client care is one of the prime areas where the tenets of lean startup (like building minimum viable products, measuring impact, and validating learnings), are not only feasible, but crucial to providing the innovation that consumers have come to expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically in banking, you might assume that product and program launches have gone through 23 layers of administration, have only been tested internally, and take years to roll out and implement, sometimes rendering the final solution irrelevant in market. At ATB, our innovation team is constantly taking client problems and iterating quickly to find solutions and learn from &ldquo;the end user&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Referral Program with Alberta Registries is a perfect example of agile learning and delivering a product to customers as quickly as possible. As the bank for Alberta entrepreneurs, we are constantly looking for ways to add value, and save time. Here is how we took lessons from lean startup to quickly get a product to market to satisfy a real customer need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all started with a problem: how can we make it easier and quicker for new entrepreneurs to set up business banking? We started hacking for a solution by talking to entrepreneurs, and walking through their journey: who do they interact with, what are key milestones, and what other organizations are they connecting with? It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that any entrepreneur, at an early stage in their journey, will connect with an Alberta Registry Agent for their business license. It&rsquo;s at this step in their path that they take the time to begin to bring their dream to life. Once we forged partnerships with Alberta Registry Agents, within two weeks we had rolled out a prototype experience to tie together the business registration process with an easy referral for business banking, without any additional time required to find a banking partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t waste time building a perfect solution, instead we got a minimum viable product out into the world to quickly iterate and create a feedback loop to develop a solution that would meet customer needs. Today, all it takes is a few extra questions with the registry agent, a simple form that that the registry office sends over to ATB&rsquo;s Business Centre, and our specialists can start getting account details set up without a customer ever setting foot in a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of innovation that we are crazy about here at ATB. Obviously we are working on the tech heavy stuff as well, like AI, bots, banking through Facebook messenger, blockchain, and biometrics. But there are also vast opportunities for low risk, high impact innovations in our day to day processes that create positive change for our customers. That&rsquo;s why we put such a heavy focus on cross-team collaboration and innovation at ATB. We want to quickly identify problems and test out minimum viable solutions. It is that culture of innovation, and the willingness to embrace lean startup that will help us lead the way in business banking and be at the forefront of innovation in the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to transform day-to-day processes into impactful moments?

Many of us have experienced it - but at ATB this is the antithesis of what we strive for. Our over 5,000 team members across the province are highly skilled, talented, personable, creative, and genuinely enjoy their jobs. We know that each team member has an incredible amount to share with us, and they have game-changing ideas to bring to the table. The challenge is building an environment where those ideas can be sparked into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where Innoventure comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innoventure is a 12-week program we developed in house to bring brilliant ideas to the surface. We weren&rsquo;t sure how many team members would jump on board, but right away we had response from so many diverse parts of ATB, we decided to start our journey with a nimble group of 20 of those team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one started off with an intro to Innoventure, the basics of creating business models and discovering a minimum viable product. We were inspired by lean startup methodology for our framework. Day two we hosted a collective brainstorming session&mdash;and together, we came up with over 100 ideas for ATB to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this round of Innoventure, we&rsquo;ve narrowed those 100 ideas down to four, focussing on opportunities that meet the needs of our clients. Our teams are now deep in research and business model development to prepare to pitch their ideas to an internal business panel for viability and execution. The ideas that made the cut focus on exciting opportunities like connecting our more than 80,000(!) entrepreneurs with one another, and building financial confidence of our customers, to name a couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to share more in-depth intel on the ideas that that make it through the pitch round, and then we&rsquo;ll move to step two: understanding the potential positive impact for our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of teammates throwing innovation at our customers and seeing what sticks&mdash;this is time and resources, passion and exploration, and maybe even some blood, sweat, and tears, all centred on listening to our clients and developing solutions to make banking, and life, better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for top talent to be part of programs just like Innoventure.

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions where real-world challenges are posted with training data and teams compete to create models that have high predictive performance. With over a half-million users, Kaggle is one of the largest and most active data science communities in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competitions are an entry place and training ground for some of the top talent in data science from across the globe. Competitors are ranked based on their models&rsquo; predictive capabilities on a separate test data set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you are going to participate in a Kaggle competition or know someone who is, here&rsquo;s what our talented team learned along their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 1: Communication is key</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the early stages of competition, you don&rsquo;t have to declare your team, but at the merge date, you must be within the total maximum of submissions (daily maximum X number of competition days) in order to merge team members. This means it is crucial to coordinate in advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 2: Implement version control for submissions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It&rsquo;s embarrassing to show up to a party with the exact same outfit as someone else, the same goes for submitting the same model as other members of your team. Make sure you coordinate submissions to ensure you won&rsquo;t have multiple team members submitting the same model. Dating and versioning submissions becomes even more important near the end of competition when you are looking at ensemble modeling and maximizing lift on high functioning models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 3: Say NO to procrastination. &nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nAlthough this is easier said than done, finding solutions to Kaggle problems requires creativity, experimentation, testing, and a lot of time waiting for models to run. So waiting until the last minute to start working means you may miss out on the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 4: Recognize the value of diversity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Having team members from diverse backgrounds, such as engineering, mathematics, and physics, can greatly increase your chances of discovering solutions that you would not have thought of alone. Each team member brings their own experiences, biases, and expertise, so having a diverse team is greatly beneficial when solving complex problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In fact, beyond the education/professional backgrounds, look at building a team with diversity in age, gender, and culture too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 5: Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day: spend time on feature engineering, especially for structured data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll increase your chances of model fit if you take the time to clean the dataset and explore feature engineering opportunities like testing for usefulness of individual features, combining related categories to allow for a more simplified predictive model, or constructing new features out of the raw data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">More features is not always better, and not all features are created equal. Feature engineering allows you to optimize and understand the input data, which should generally allow you to use more simplified models and improve performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 6: Diversity enables again! Domain knowledge is a benefit.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Speaking of feature engineering, having team members with domain knowledge and spending time to understand features can aid in feature engineering and predicting models. Look to build your team with intention and diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 7: Try black box solutions and ensemble modelling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">There are some great black box solutions for feature engineering. In a time sensitive competition environment, they are worth trying out. In real-life application, black box modelling is often limited to testing and validation, since understand why a model works is of critical importance. However in a Kaggle competition, testing models for incremental lift through any means necessary is what will take you up in the rankings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One of the top winning strategies for Kaggle competitions is ensemble modelling, which can provide a much needed incremental lift in the last stages of competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Ensemble modelling entails synthesizing the results from one or more models into a single score or spread. Again, in real-world application this often has negative effects on the explainability of a model, but in a Kaggle competition it is one of the top strategies of winning teams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 8: Do your homework.&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile we want to be a one-stop-shop for expertise, we know that no two competitions will ever be the same. So, look at winning strategies for similar competitions and check out as many forums as possible that provide learnings and tips for winning Kaggle competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 9: It takes a village - connect with the crowd.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Many people post open source solutions on Kaggle Kernels, it&rsquo;s there for you to be inspired, so don&rsquo;t miss out on this as a resource. Just don&rsquo;t make the mistake of copying models directly without thinking or making any changes or improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 10: Try training models with parallel computing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll be pressed for time, so make sure to try high efficiency parallel computing models like XGboost or Light GBM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Both models are gradient boosting methods and are the two best performing (both in speed and metric performance) machine learning algorithms for large datasets. Neither method is sensitive to over fitting, giving you the opportunity to use more features and to save time on feature engineering for large datasets without compromising performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Light GBM was the method used for the winning submission in the Kaggle competition that our team competed in. Compared to XGboost&rsquo;s level wise tree growth, Light GBM grows &lsquo;leaf wise,&rsquo; which means it reduces loss and is more accurate than XG boost. Light GBM uses a histogram based algorithm, which results in a faster training speed and higher efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Compute time is valuable when your team is testing hundreds of models. This is one of the reasons that techniques that are more efficient at finding high performance models are particularly useful in Kaggle competitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 11: Even if you can&rsquo;t see it, it still exists!&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Think about the data that isn&rsquo;t staring you in the face! Even if your model works on the training data, it won&rsquo;t necessarily perform equally as well on the test data. Make sure you&rsquo;re building a model that will be effective on more than just the training data set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it, 11 tips extracted from ATB&rsquo;s very own Kagglers (they ranked 17th out of 231 teams from across the world, at one point in the competition, ranking 2nd place). Challenging ourselves and being intentional about testing and honing our skills is one of our favourite things to do at ATB. In your next Kaggle competition, take these learnings to keep pushing the limits of your capabilities in order to continue to serve those around you in innovative ways, just as our team does every day for Albertans.&nbsp;Are you interested in working with team members who are constantly hungry to learn more and improve their skills?

We&rsquo;re talking about things like ethics in artificial intelligence, bias in software development, and a need for design that is accessible and inclusive. Designers are creating online forms where people don&rsquo;t have to indicate a gender that they don&rsquo;t identify with. Inclusive design is incorporating different cultural perspectives and ways of speaking into voice activated apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, inclusive design brings us things like biometric identification to offer banking services to people who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have access. For us, inclusive design starts with how we build our teams. We practice what we preach - we want our team to practice inclusive design, so we use design thinking to build the team, culture, and workspace to achieve that outcome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in inclusive design is to set the intention and expectation that inclusivity will be built into every step of the process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we were intentional about building diversity into our teams. It is not only about ethnicity and gender, but also age, experience, beliefs, language, strengths, and weaknesses. On our design team, all team members have user design experience, but we have also hired for massively varied backgrounds and skill sets (creative, computer, product, content).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dedication to bringing diverse perspectives into the design process has led to a democratization of design at ATB. Instead of trying to own the design process, we practice transparency, openness, sharing, and radical collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our CX Research and Design Hub is an online portal where we openly share the work of the design team with our 5,300 team members. The processes, the data, the prototypes, the iterations, everything is open to see. Our goal is to contribute to the practice of design and design thinking across the organization, and ultimately, help everyone at ATB get closer to the customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anyone who influences how the design comes about is the designer.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collaborative focus feeds inclusive design across ATB. Our commitment to listen to Albertans stems from the desire to provide experiences and products that fit their needs. We&rsquo;ve taken a real stand about putting human beings at the centre of our business.&nbsp;<strong>Human Centered Design is inclusive by nature, and ATB is committed to making this part of what we&rsquo;re known for, part of our DNA.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no written code of ethics or code of conduct for the design and tech world. But as a profession, we aim to be in touch with the user and the human experience.

Not just 22 paddlers pulling oars in the same boat, but 5000 Albertans all driven by the same mission and pulling in the same direction to transform banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How we are creating alignment across team members comes down to the communication of our expectations and creating a shared culture around what it means to be All In.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about the idea of being &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; at ATB for a number of years. Only recently, in fact just this last year, we created a simple and clear &nbsp;&ldquo;Team Member All In&rdquo; framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invest a lot of time to help team members really understand, connect and align with our culture and values. After about 100 days or so, our orientation program for new team members culminates in an &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; commitment call with our CEO and Chief People Officer. In the call we ask new team members to tell us what they honestly think about their ATB experience so far and to share their personal stories and commitment to being &lsquo;all-in.&rsquo; In fact, once in awhile a new team member tells us that they are not &lsquo;all-in&rsquo;. We really listen to their &lsquo;why&rsquo; and help them find their way: where they can best apply their passions and be &lsquo;all-in,&rsquo; wherever that may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All In isn&rsquo;t just a slogan with statements on the wall. We expect all team members to believe wholeheartedly in the 94 word story, to live the ATB values, and to give their best effort everyday to transform banking and use it as a medium to create happiness for Albertans. Responsibility is not passed on to colleagues, other teams, or leaders - it is up to every ATB team member to make the story come to life, everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our commitment is evident in surrounding team members with an awesome work environment and culture, being fully empowered to make changes, providing the best&nbsp;experience to customers, and taking risks to explore novel applications of technology in banking. We believe our team members and our leaders have the obligation and responsibility to become great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One area we&rsquo;re are particularly excited about is the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB AI Lab</a>&nbsp;in Spring 2018. We&rsquo;re currently recruiting a Managing Director who will help define ATB&rsquo;s enterprise AI strategy and the overall direction of the company&rsquo;s AI &amp; Machine Learning Lab. This is the type of exciting position where we empower our team members and leaders to make bold discoveries, and we expect them to be all-in.

So we empower team members to ask themselves, &lsquo;how might I need to change and grow to help the company change and grow?&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why have we formalized our commitment to be &lsquo;all-in?&rsquo; In our evolution, the All In framework brings together a lot of what we have been talking about for years - our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atb.com/about/Pages/our-story.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">story</a>, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atb.com/listen/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to listening</a>, and the ATB&rsquo;s (our guiding principles, including a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/atbfinancial/status/1010223624056270848\" target=\"_blank\">newly introduced 11th ATB</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power of aligning what it means to be &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; is inspiring. It all starts with making a personal connection&mdash;individuals matching their values and purpose with their work&mdash;and then aligning people working together towards a common aspiration in a way that reflects our values and mission as an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ATB is not a place for clock-punchers, ladder climbers, or spotlight stealers.

So in this alphaBeta content series we are exploring what it takes to be continuously innovative - what are the qualities needed? Is it something you are born with or can an innovative mindset be nurtured?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following up on Part 1, where we shared our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/24\">recipe for creating innovative ideas</a><a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cooking-up-innovation-part-1-a-recipe-for-success\">,</a> now we&rsquo;re dishing out some of our top lessons on the innate qualities of innovators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What qualities make an innovator?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate between nature and nurture as the foundation of an innovative mind, we&rsquo;ve found that it is a mixture of both that is crucial, with the common thread being an individual with a growth mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means someone with the ability to face failure and a level of comfort with ambiguity. Someone who is always willing to learn and change. Someone who can leave their mind open enough to make connections that others might miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of serving ATB customers with an open mind is the ability to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; beyond words. Whether we are conducting user tests for internal technology products or creating happiness through banking for ATB customers on the front lines,&nbsp;<strong>our ability to listen gives purpose to innovation. For any innovator, listening to the environment and people around you is a powerful guidepost. Listening ensures that you&rsquo;re chasing truly meaningful and impactful ideas, avoiding the pitfall of innovating for the sake of innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are proud of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our team members. Just like there is no clear and defined path to become an innovator, there is no single set process to become a Transformer; but here are some of the innate qualities that we look for in our team members:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grit.</strong>&nbsp;Someone with grit is not afraid to roll up their sleeves and leave ego at the door, they work outside their comfort zone and regularly do things that are &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; their knowledge or ability, when it will create positive change for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Passion.&nbsp;</strong>Being driven by a bigger purpose brings a certain kind of energy that is not otherwise possible. ATB is driven by the mission to create happiness for Albertans through banking, that&rsquo;s what drives everything we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perseverance.&nbsp;</strong>Someone with perseverance has the ability to get back up when they get knocked down over and over (and over) again. When training your physical body or your mind, there are steep inclines and long plateaus. Perseverance means having the determination to power uphill through the difficult parts and the patience to continue when fighting through a plateau. Every time you feel a new challenge, know that if you stick it out one day you&rsquo;ll look back and think &lsquo;wow, when was I ever not an expert on this?&rsquo; It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get easier, but every time is less scary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many of the qualities of an innovator are inherent, there are also plenty of soft-skills that make the difference between having a creative idea and actually bringing that idea to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation = creativity + execution</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Communication and leadership skills will often make or break the ability of a creative person to execute on an idea.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will your crazy idea positively impact your organization? You must be able to listen without bias or judgement and communicate the vision to management to get buy in. You must inspire your team members in order to leverage their talents and successfully carry out your crazy idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So whether you&rsquo;re a natural born innovator, a creative-type building the soft-skills to turn ideas into reality, or a career minded individual looking to nurture your creative side - if you have grit, passion, perseverance, and the ability to truly listen, we&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ll get there.

There is no denying it. They run deep and have the potential to sabotage the design process, as we unknowingly build for ourselves rather than users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our practice here at ATB, we have built systems to safeguard the design process from the trap of our own bias. It starts with how we talk about our users. User is cold. Human is real. User is detached. Human is personal.&nbsp;<strong>So how do we build for&nbsp;<em>humans</em>, not&nbsp;<em>users</em>?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the heart of the human, we&rsquo;ve built in tests at each stage of our human centred design process to help us overcome our biases and put our &lsquo;human&rsquo; first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #1 - Have we talked with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; lately?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In phase one of the design process, we engage and discover. As designers, we need to empathize with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; and immerse ourselves in their experiences. At ATB, this means sitting in on the call-center, working for a day in a branch, and interacting directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personas are a tool to make the customer more &lsquo;real&rsquo; - but what&rsquo;s even better is a real customer.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a busy work schedule full of meetings and deadlines, it can be hard to dedicate time to engage and immerse ourselves. It&rsquo;s amazing how often we don&rsquo;t just get out of chairs and engage with humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, we&rsquo;ve built it into our schedules.</strong>&nbsp;Instead of standing meetings for persona building in isolated meeting rooms, our CX team has scheduled out-of-office days to talk to the humans we&rsquo;re building for, and then we share learnings back with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #2 - Did we ask&nbsp;<em>the right&nbsp;</em>questions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now you&rsquo;re actually engaging with customers and asking questions, but getting to the heart of their needs also means asking the right questions. We&rsquo;re always trying to perfect the art of asking the right question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I asked you to draw a sunset right now, what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if I asked you to draw for me the most memorable sunset you&rsquo;ve experienced, now what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are also a really great way to uncover biases. Listen to ATB Managing Director of CX talk about the magic of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\"><strong>Questions from Kids</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #3 - Did we validate&hellip;with humans?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve gone through the discovery phase and the prototyping phase, and now we are implementing a real product. We can&rsquo;t simply deliver the product and then pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next task. There is still work to be done validating that we&rsquo;ve really solved the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is crucial is bringing in the learnings from the discovery phase into the next phases of the design process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when redesigning the appointment booking process for ATB.com, one of our important observations in the discovery phase was that customers wanted more assurance that they are on the right track. They want to know if they are asking for the banking products, and that they can trust the person giving them advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we&rsquo;ve moved from discovery to the UX design, it can be easy to get lost in the usability and esthetic of the booking process. So we have to continually go back to the human we are designing for to make sure we are satisfying their core needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UX experience of booking an appointment online, this meant bringing forward this core theme of validation and assurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say an ATB customer, Allison wants to open an RESP, so she is booking an appointment online at ATB.com. Treating her like a human means that we should do more than let her pick a location and time, we should ask about her life. She is a new mom and is interested in saving for her kid&rsquo;s education. So, when her appointment is booked, we can tell her she&rsquo;ll be meeting with Angela, an ATB advisor with three kids of her own who has been in Alison&rsquo;s shoes. We can also be ready with other information about banking products and saving plans that fit her needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By building in validation through every step of the design process, we&rsquo;ve taken something that was quite transactional, scheduling a meeting online, and we&rsquo;ve made it much more personal. That is, human. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in applying human centred design to transform banking?&nbsp;Learn more about our open positions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"22.02.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":41,"title":"Using predictive analytics for social impact: ATB competes in the Women in Data Science Datathon.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/041/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:46","facets":["progress","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>Sometimes the pressure and excitement of a team competition brings out the best in people. We know that our data scientists at ATB are amongst the brightest in the world, so when we have a chance to compete against some of the top teams, we don&rsquo;t think twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, four ATB team members competed in the Women in Datascience (WiDS) Datathon, predictive analytics challenge hosted by Kaggle and put on in a joint effort between the Institute for Computational &amp; Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University, Intuit, West Big Data Innovation Hub, and InterMedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition seeks to encourage teams (that must be 50 per cent women) to apply machine learning and statistical modeling in a predictive analytics challenge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this instance, teams were given a dataset with over 1200 features on demographics and behavior and were tasked with building a model to predict the gender of survey respondents. Read more about how the predictive models are intended to help design financial services for those excluded from the formal financial system:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional and mobile financial services. The dataset is a product of InterMedia&rsquo;s research to help the world&rsquo;s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system. By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>&mdash; WiDS Conference</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 231 teams made up of 512 competitors from across the world. Teams were provided a training data set, which comprised 16 per cent of the entire data. In preliminary submissions running models on the training data, ATB was ranked second amongst the 231 competing teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final rankings were tabulated when the predictive models were run on remainder of the dataset not used for training; ATB ultimately finished 17th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the thrill of a high pressure competition and the excitement of being ranked second leading up to the finish - there were important learnings that the team took away from the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After almost 80 models tested by team members, the final ATB submission was a weighted average of the top three models developed by the team - a real group effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beyond the team building and the excitement of getting ATB on the map within the world&rsquo;s largest machine learning community, the model and the techniques used to develop it could potentially be applied to other challenges.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though predicting binary gender is not an exact solution that ATB would be implementing, the challenge was fundamentally a classification problem. A similar predictive model could be used for predicting fraud, or other attributes that might help ATB team members provide optimal service to customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tackling the classification problem also gave ATB data scientists an excellent opportunity to test the machine learning technique of extreme gradient boosting on a real data set. This highlights an exciting outcome of participating in competitions: the opportunity to discover and use tools and techniques in the developing field of machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big shout out to the ATB WiDS team,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samiul-azam-59247b11b/\" target=\"_blank\">Samiul Azam</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukun-zhang-89283b35/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukun Zhang</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-akinwumi-phd-a68041147/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Akinwumi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunjan-k-b34b1513b/\" target=\"_blank\">Gunjan Kaur</a>.

She&mdash;or he, or it, depending on who you ask&mdash;has created quite a splash in the media for her charming personality.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey with Pepper has been an unexpected one thus far. We initially brought her onto the team expecting that she would be popular with Millennials, but the opposite has proven true; it&rsquo;s the older and younger generations who love her. They&rsquo;re happy with simple voice interaction and enchanted by her kindness and capability to recognize their facial expressions and answer questions. Millennials, on the other hand, expect more of Pepper&mdash;they want their sh*t figured out, and fast, but Pepper is no Siri. Yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, Pepper is in robot infancy. Her software determines her capabilities and limitations. Which is why we&rsquo;ve been testing, learning and continuously iterating Pepper&rsquo;s software on a rinse/repeat cycle. Sometimes the cycle requires new software to actually be developed before a new version of Pepper is ready to hit the streets&mdash;or ATB carpets, as it were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring the possibility of being able to have more fluid conversations with Pepper, during which she could assess customer needs and make swift recommendations. Ideally, she&rsquo;d remember customers from visit to visit in order to follow up with them. We&rsquo;d also like to find out how we can employ biometrics to make the customer experience even more personalized and helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s not going to take over the world (that would take some serious software), she&rsquo;s not even going to steal jobs from humans, which seems to be a common fear. The fact of the matter is Pepper can&rsquo;t replace the meaningful work humans do at ATB. What she can do is diminish &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work and help develop more relationships with our customers. And with less grunt work, our team can focus on interesting and impactful work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1548803104353_509\">Pepper&rsquo;s ideal workplace may not even be at ATB branches. The focus of our research is to gain understanding on where our customers see a robot fitting in and being helpful. Because our customers are at our branches, that&rsquo;s where our research starts.

As ATB&rsquo;s first customer service robot, she has travelled around the province greeting ATB customers and Albertans in branches, showhomes, registry offices, and at university Welcome Weeks, trade shows, and other ATB-sponsored events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her job is to engage and delight customers and to complement the service that ATB team members provide. Through our proof of concept testing with Pepper, we&rsquo;ve gathered data and feedback from her interactions and gleaned incredible insights into how she can best serve ATB&rsquo;s current and future customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few of the things we&rsquo;ve learned from Pepper in her first year on the job:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>People expect her to be smart(er)</strong><br />\r\n\tMaybe we&rsquo;ve all been conditioned by movies that feature highly intelligent robots, but in reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, and natural language processing still have some pretty big limitations. We&rsquo;ve found that Pepper&rsquo;s human form means that people expect her to have human-like intelligence. Up to now, her interactions have all been programmed and she wasn&rsquo;t capable of free-form conversation. We are working hard to build her future capabilities as an intelligent robot that can educate our customers, complete tasks on their behalf, or connect them with our human team members.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She has the potential to break down barriers</strong><br />\r\n\tVoice technology is not comfortable for everyone. In many cases, people aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to interact with robots and with voice activated technology.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>People may not be quite ready to trust robots to do their banking, but in the meantime, we&rsquo;re gathering important learnings about what makes people comfortable and able to interact with Pepper. She is slowly building relationships and potentially helping us to bring new banking options to customers that might not otherwise be comfortable engaging with digital banking tools or machines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She likes strangers (and strangers like her!)</strong><br />\r\n\tOutside of the branch, Pepper&rsquo;s skills and personality were incredibly valuable. In our tests at showhomes, in registry offices, and on campus for student Welcome Weeks, Pepper provided concise and relevant information to potential new ATB customers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it is a challenge in branches to provide the complex service that our ATB team members excel at, when Pepper is programmed with information relevant to a narrow audience (like potential homeowners, business owners, or students), Pepper was much more capable of providing customer service and valuable information.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s not great at multitasking</strong><br />\r\n\tWe mentioned the limitations of the current state of natural language processing and voice technology. Two of the challenges Pepper faces are: not being able to speak and listen at the same time and difficulty processing multiple voices at once.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>Taking this into account, loud locations with multiple speakers are not the most suitable work location for Pepper. We were able to narrow down the contexts to which Pepper is most suited and we&rsquo;re building experiences that shine in specific locations with a narrow audience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>First impressions matter</strong><br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve learned that it is crucial for Pepper to offer real value in a first interaction in order for people to be eager to talk with her again. So we&rsquo;re making sure she is in the right places at the right time with the artificial intelligence she needs to truly provide value to our customers. She captures the ATB core value of using banking to create happiness, but she is more than an entertainer, so we&rsquo;re ensuring she has the tools to make our customers&rsquo; lives easier.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>When Pepper debuted in ATB branches in Spring 2017, we didn&rsquo;t know how customers would react or what learnings we would find, but her first year on the job proved immensely valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice will play an increasingly important role in our future. At ATB we&rsquo;re excited about technology that will help reduce friction in banking. We can imagine a time soon when customers are driving to work and using a smart car audio system to transfer money, asking a smart TV to connect via video to a financial advisor, or asking a home voice assistant to pay the utility bills while they&rsquo;re doing the dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we&rsquo;re learning now from Pepper will help us optimize the user experience across voice-based channels.</strong>&nbsp;Pepper is just one channel of many, and she&rsquo;s the first generation of customer service robots that we can use to learn and improve how we serve our customers using technology in physical spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper&rsquo;s future is now splitting in two directions. She&rsquo;ll continue to be tested as brand ambassador for ATB at public events, embodying the friendly, helpful culture of ATB. Her second role will evolve as we continue to improve her natural language capabilities, perform tests with connecting her to internal systems, and introduce robotics processing automation to complete tasks for customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through it all, Pepper will continue to do what she does best:&nbsp;<strong>balance the digital future of banking with the friendly personal touch that ATB is known for.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in exploring the future of robotics process automation with colleagues like Pepper?

As part of that mission, we declared that we would become an agile development shop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve proven that it was more than just a statement. We&rsquo;ve changed how our teams work, we&rsquo;ve recruited top talent from around the globe, we&rsquo;ve put customers at the centre of our development processes. And we&rsquo;ve shipped some incredible products as a result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the journey so far, there has been massive uptake of agile development process across the pillars of our organization. But it is not something that is only relegated to the scrums and sprints of our software development teams.&nbsp;<strong>We&rsquo;ve proven that we can innovate processes - and now we&rsquo;re stepping back to bring some focus and coordination to take the agile mindset to the entire organization. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In true agile style, we&rsquo;re testing and continuously adjusting our targets. One of the things that we&rsquo;ve learned in our journey is that&nbsp;<strong>a key component to success is a common understanding across teams of what agile means.</strong>&nbsp;Team members need the tools and frameworks, along with the skills and knowledge, to apply agile principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To increase the consistency across innovation pillars at ATB, we&rsquo;ve set out to make sure ATB team members have a common baseline understanding of agile. This starts off with a training program that we&rsquo;ve deployed through comprehensive online tools. Of course, we launched the training to a small test group, got feedback and adapted.&nbsp;<strong>With the help of agile champions, we&rsquo;ve now rolled out agile training paths tailored to each ATB Transformation team member.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we&rsquo;re tackling duplication across teams through onboarding and clear evaluation of initiatives; we&rsquo;re optimizing the size and composition of our squads and we&rsquo;re experimenting with agile planning on rolling schedules, reviewed quarterly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our slick new agile style doesn&rsquo;t mean it&#39;s all run-and-gun with no reporting - part of the structure is making sure we have accountability built in, but not at the expense of the speed. As we build agility across ATB, we&rsquo;ll be quicker at bringing together and disbanding project teams, allocating budgets, and shutting down projects as required. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working on bringing the agile mindset to ATB as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know we&rsquo;re on a trajectory to redefine how we do things here at ATB, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we know exactly where the journey will take us. Just like an agile software development team, our small team leading the agile movement at ATB is letting the client, ATB Team members, help define the end goal and the steps along the way. One thing we do know: we have a mission to transform banking and we&rsquo;re on our way there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you think you have what it takes to go agile?

It&rsquo;s been a key driver in e-commerce and the business world in general for years. But what does it mean for consumers? In fact, not many consumers would articulate that they want a &lsquo;seamless shopping experience across all online and physical shopping channels.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consistency is not necessarily what people are looking for. What they want is optichannel, where they can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of human centered approach that sets ATB apart in our approach to designing banking services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - you can optimize voice interaction for telephone banking, but when someone is on the train, they don&rsquo;t want to be reading out their bank card number. They want the option to have the experience that fits the channel they are using and the context they are in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans make these sorts of contextual decisions constantly throughout the day. Imagine an individual planning a family get together and needing to contact a grandmother, siblings, and parents. They are likely subconsciously picking the right time and the right channel through which to communicate with each person. A phone call to grandma, a text to the parents, and an email to a sister&rsquo;s work email to make sure she sees the message in time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re taking the same approach with banking services.&nbsp;<strong>It&#39;s more than providing the best voice experience, or a seamless switch from desktop to mobile. It&rsquo;s about knowing our customers and delivering what they need at the right time through channels and experiences that fit the situation and context.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The banking sector is not particularly well known for providing optimized customer-centric experiences. Partially due to legacy systems and siloed structures, it can be challenging for traditional banks to take the customer centric approach required to delivery exceptional optichannel experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where our<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">&nbsp;human centric design approach&nbsp;</a>pays off. We also told you about our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/from-transaction-to-human-interaction-ux-powered-rapid-account-opening\" target=\"_blank\">versatile digital platform</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/44\">,</a> allowing us to break through the restriction of siloed business functions typical in banking. This allows us to build experiences and processes based on the customer journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - we&rsquo;re testing things like robotics process automation with our customer service robot,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">Pepper.</a> Pepper currently provides banking information to prospective customers in person in showhomes and registry agencies, places where people need banking information but where live ATB team members are not available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re all about interacting on a human level. In a digital world, this means making sure that our online channels are as heartwarming and personal as speaking live with an ATB team member. Our customer-centric optichannel approach helps solidify ATB as Alberta&rsquo;s bank for digital and in person banking services that provides personalization and context appropriate experiences to our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you customer- centric just like we are?

This expectation not only applies to the banking industry, but also to industries such as retail and hospitality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we transform the in-branch experience, we know that pooling our chips will help us leverage the collective knowledge of staff and customers to marry the ATB story with the experience of entering a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that one of the most important parts of the transformation is to listen to the needs of Albertans. Part of this journey is a collaboration with ATB team members working in branches and co-creating directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of transformation is much more than researching trends in other industries or undertaking customer surveys. We&rsquo;ve committed resources to the pre-work of understanding our network of physical spaces. This included a process of evaluating each branch, its role in the network, business performance, facility costs, space details, current customer experience, and important factors about the community that the branch serves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in the co-creation process is the data-driven evaluation of our branches as a network, rather than optimizing each location in isolation. We have hypotheses, but we won&rsquo;t know for sure until we&rsquo;ve heard it from our customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is where co-creation comes in. Our goal is to uncover the key insights about the customer journey, the defining moments, and how we can use our physical environments to enhance the customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we design the optimal branch experience, we&rsquo;ll be incorporating &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Service design - principles &amp; practices of team members in the branch. What skills and training they need and what behaviours deliver the experience customers desire.</li>\r\n\t<li>Environment design - physical space design that creates the desired atmosphere for customers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technology design - tech that supports the experience - how are we leveraging technology for a superior branch experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the co-creation process, we&rsquo;ll be discovering the type of customer experience that we need to build into our branch design and the feelings that we want customers to walk away feeling after visiting an ATB branch. While we learn what the customer experience should be, here are a few things that we know it is not:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not the same as customer service.&nbsp;</strong>The &lsquo;experience&rsquo; portion is about understanding the touch points across the entire journey. How do we use the branches as a platform to discover more about our customers? How do we leverage in-person interactions to build trust faster and enable better service across all platforms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not high tech for the sake of being &lsquo;cool.&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>Tech should enable, save time, and build relationships. The tech solution itself is not the answer. For example, a customer might say that they find pulling out their driver&#39;s licence for identification clumsy and they would prefer biometrics - but what they want is more efficient authentication, whatever the technology implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a about designing aspects in isolation.&nbsp;</strong>It is rather the culmination of touchpoints across the customer journey. Reducing the friction in the journey. Form and function in our branches are complementary. Efficiency of space use is equally important to optimizing how customers move through the space. Sensory stimulation should be meaningful and pleasing, but may also achieve a desired outcome, like learning or reinforcing shared values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a singular problem to be solved,&nbsp;</strong>but rather an iterative journey. That means that our branch design should be flexible enough to evolve over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet, but the path to get there is deeply rooted in customer experience and how we can use our branch locations to connect with our customers in ways that we haven&rsquo;t been able to before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, humans want to interact with humans. Though the ability to bank online and on-the-go is essential, we are betting on a future where physical branches are still a crucial part of our business. We are here to serve, and branches provide the enormous opportunity for ATB to build personal connections with our customers, discover more about their needs, and find the defining moments for each individual&rsquo;s financial journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CNzeFbV6cudvgTOkrVcByx4hghvSahm6BdLOViKbwg/edit?ts=5b1945b4\" target=\"_blank\">explore open opportunities</a>&nbsp;with ATB&rsquo;s Transformation team.</strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"co-creating-new-in-person-experiences","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":32,"title":"Community, colleagues, and culture at ATB.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/032/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:05","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>We work in a special place.

In order to truly ensure that we design for our customers, we need to build teams that embrace and embody diversity of thought. We bring a lens of humanity and empathy to make sure that happiness is the end goal in developing new technologies and serving our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Campus life.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it like to work at ATB? It would be a change for us if things weren&rsquo;t changing. We plan weeks or months in advance, not years. Change is a norm here and something we embrace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our Calgary Campus, work goes beyond office walls. We have a Toastmasters club, composting lunch-and-learns, a summer farmer&rsquo;s market. It is so much more than X floor in Y office, it is really a campus life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of campus, Calgary is one of our best-kept-secrets. Not simply an energy and cowboy town, there are incredible technology companies, agencies, and organizations that are headquartered in Calgary. Not to mention a burgeoning AI community in the province, including our very own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AI Partnership</a>&nbsp;up the road in Edmonton with the University of Alberta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We get the best of both worlds - a metropolitan city, all the dining and nightlife you could ask for, and incredible career opportunities with reasonable commutes and an inspiring outdoor element to life. We are really a 365 day per year outdoor city. You can&rsquo;t resist the draw of bright, crisp winter days, the Rocky Mountains, and endless rivers, streams, and trails.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to attract incredible talent and diversity to our teams here at ATB.&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">we&rsquo;re hiring</a>!

But it&rsquo;s not as simple as setting a bot loose and seeing massive returns in time and money saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we are very strategic in how we are rolling out robotic process automation. From how we decide which processes to tackle, to rolling out pilots, to tweaking and optimizing the processes themselves, we&rsquo;re putting great thought into how we can leverage robotic process automation to create better experiences for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our first priority is to identify where we can create the most value or solve the most pressing customer problem. With over three thousand internal and customer facing processes at ATB, we had to devise a strategy to evaluate and prioritize where to leverage automation. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star, our mission, of zero-disappointed customers, we started by documenting as many of our processes as possible to identify the right opportunities. This list of 1,700 process was then layered with factors like the risk level, process volume, complaint frequency, suitability for automation, and level of importance for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is a heat-map and listing of our internal processes by order of priority for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the processes that came out on top was customers making changes to their address on file. An occurrence that comes up frequency in the the lives of ATB customers. Internally, we have multiple systems in which an address change needs to occur, with plenty of downstream effects if there are delays or errors. For a customer, the request is straightforward: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve moved, I need to change my address.&rsquo; And, in the middle of a move, they have no time to spare and don&rsquo;t need any extra stress! This combination of factors makes address changes a prime candidate for a robotic process automation solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the other things that our process automation team does in our evaluation of processes is to take the lens of &lsquo;do we need to do this?&rsquo; and &lsquo;does this add value for the customer?&rsquo; We don&rsquo;t want to automate bad processes. We want to make necessary processes smarter, improve the business rules, and streamline the steps in a process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automation and process optimization are not new concepts. What is new today is the ease with which they can be applied and the broad use cases and scale of solutions. Where backend integrations usually require the accommodation of every possibility, robotics can isolate outliers that don&rsquo;t pass validation checks or adhere to business rules, breaking the &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; paradigm of automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we build our internal capabilities, the applications of drag-and-drop solutions and robots-as-a-service are enormous. Where connections with third party applications may be limited by permission to make changes or batch processes, robotics can allow us to connect even to external programs through APIs. Our early applications of robotic process automation are also scalable and adaptable to other business areas with little to no development work required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still early in our journey with automation. When we started, we used robotics software that mimics human actions. It basically automated the repetitive task of entering information. It picked up the request in one location and actioned it across multiple systems based on predetermined rules. For example, a staff member changes an address in a certain location and it activates an automated process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we added an app script to improve the user experience of initiating the request and remove the barrier of knowing in advance what form to fill out to activate the process. The third evolution is to layer on machine learning and natural language processing to allow for dynamic interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Robotic automation is what will ultimately bring the capacities of artificial intelligence and machine learning to customers. As the team progressively learns and improves, we are moving from local automation of one-off processes to creating end-to-end solutions. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are moving towards turning natural language inputs into structured data that results in action, rather than an information response. So you say &lsquo;I need to change my address&rsquo; and, instead of written instructions about where to go and what to do, a responding information request actions an automated backend process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re focussed on applying technology in areas that impact customers most. Robotics process automation applied to the right use-cases means better customer experience, and more time for us to hear our customers. Just one of the ways we are working every day to make banking better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you passionate about implementing technology to solve customer problems and improving customer experiences?

At ATB, we are building our capabilities and skill sets to be prepared for a new fast-paced world. And we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from individuals who are set for success with diverse knowledge and skills and the ability to quickly adapt when jobs are automated or required skill sets change.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of &lsquo;unicorn&rsquo; employees. Those magical creatures who seem to be capable of doing anything thrown at them, and doing it well. They are called unicorns because we&rsquo;ve heard stories of them, but often only second-hand&mdash;do they really exist? It is our prediction that these &lsquo;unicorns&rsquo; will become the norm: more of a swiss-army-workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The swiss-army-workforce knows how to acquire the tools required for whatever needs to be accomplished. Later in their careers, swiss-army-knife employees have extremely broad experience and skills&mdash;and they know how to draw on their broad knowledge, even in completely new roles or sectors. These team members are extremely compelling as an employer&mdash;what if you could have three people with the broad skill set of 10, or team members who can quickly acquire the skills to take on a new role. People who can adapt, switch, and be fluid between roles to bring things to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still need the experts who have deep domain expertise&mdash;but equally important are people who are able to switch directions. What about all those jobs that will be replaced with automation? A swiss-army-workforce can be fearless in the face of change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the quest to be ready for the future of banking, we are exploring our innovative mindset, as an organization and at the individual level.

That means we are able to overcome barriers to do things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cracking-compliance-traditional-banking-for-unconventional-business-clients\">breaking into markets outside of traditional banking</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/going-agile-with-agility-the-road-to-organizational-agility\">constantly changing how we work internally.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another huge factor is the team. Innovation in banking won&rsquo;t come from the ideas of one individual&mdash;we&rsquo;re intentional about building a team full of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">diverse thinkers</a>&nbsp;and different backgrounds. People who are bought into the the mission and values of continuous disruption and building a future of banking for the happiness of Albertans. We have great people, and trust in our team. That means that team members have autonomy to explore new ideas and are empowered to be bold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like disruption in the job market from technological change, banking is at high risk of major upheaval. We are striving to figure out our place in that future, which means we have to think beyond what we are and towards what we could become.

We serve it to others - watching, listening, and learning what gets positive responses and how we can make it better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming an innovator follows a similar path - we start by gathering information from thought leaders and experts, followed by narrowing down ideas to key sources of trustworthy information.

Through these changes, we have relied on some sparky individuals at ATB to help us manage the evolving landscape and ensure that we have a culture of adoption and agile development internally,&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;we scale out. After all, what good is convincing Albertans to adopt new solutions when our own team members aren&rsquo;t feeling it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of our work tends to be behind-the-scenes product development and internal process improvements...things that focus on our own team members. In the early stages of our journey we relied on traditional change management techniques and found that team member adoption was low with more efforts focused on workarounds and avoiding new tools and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because traditional change management techniques were not aligning with our vision of an adoptive culture and an agile environment, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/need-more-spark-in-your-life\">Spark team</a>&nbsp;was assembled with key partnerships across our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams. Rather than traditional task lists and methodology, we&rsquo;ve blown up the typical notions of change management and taken on a lens that focuses on both adoption, and consequently, adaptation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spark team recognized the need to address multiple factors in fostering an adaptive organizational culture where team members rapidly adopt and become users of new solutions. They shifted the internal development process, stood up a dependency dashboard to keep project teams informed, improved user engagement with a methodology for surveying and interviewing, and changed our internal perceptions around failure and project termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This change in perception was crucial for success in fostering an adoptive (and adAptive) culture.&nbsp;</strong>But how does one actually target this shift within a large enterprise? We started by studying some of the most adaptive cultures in the world to uncover the features that they have in common. Here are a few of our top learnings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Adaptive cultures are constantly in flux</strong>, you have to practice to become good at change. Part of ATB&rsquo;s culture is to be comfortable being uncomfortable, this takes daily effort by each team member to step outside their comfort zone. It also takes commitment from our leadership team to be constantly adjusting targets and setting new goals.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Effective change is bottom-up, not top down.&nbsp;</strong>We have a community of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; at ATB, team members who have volunteered to be product testers and early adopters. Our goal is to eventually have the entire organization become igniters</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>It is human nature to act on what you&rsquo;re measured on.&nbsp;</strong>The Spark team celebrates and rewards our team of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; who are instrumental in the deployment process, who act as advocates for a product and support fellow team members in the adoption process.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Widespread change requires momentum.&nbsp;</strong>There will always be an adoption curve, but our goal is to move the entire curve to the left, with greater emphasis on early adopters.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Working towards a culture of adoption, we also need to have the tools to measure success and ensure we put the user at the centre of all our efforts. In addition to user logs, the Spark team has implemented qualitative feedback loops and an internal net promoter score. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another way we are demonstrating our user-centric attitude is by integrating adoption activitie</strong><strong>s.</strong>&nbsp;We are not just measuring adaptiveness, but also taking the lead on things like roadshows, branch visits, and &lsquo;Spark hours&rsquo; to help our vast network of team members embrace what&rsquo;s new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our journey to transform ourselves, and banking, the Spark team is working collaboratively with our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams to create an adaptive group of people who are hungry for new things, rather than frustrated or annoyed with new rollouts. This takes two components: products that are needed, valuable, and based on user input - and people who are accustomed to change and are active in fostering a culture of adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in being part of a team culture with people who are eager to change and adapt?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open opportunities here.</a></strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"fostering-a-culture-of-adoption","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"}],"labs":[]},{"id":59,"title":"Tech debt and digital transformation","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","date":"15.11.2018 22:14","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>In an era where every company is essentially a technology company, no organization can escape the challenge of dealing with technical debt.

Just like how we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optimizing-robotic-process-automation\">optimize</a> across all departments, we ask the questions: &lsquo;is the technology causing disappointed customers?&rsquo; or &lsquo;is it causing mistakes?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first priority is to provide the best banking experience to customers. Further layers of evaluation consider how the tech debt affects the availability, reliability, and security of our systems. Is this tool or technology needed? And what vulnerabilities does it introduce that could cause problems in how we deliver value to customers and team members? What is the minimum we need to do to get this into a supported state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way that we are constantly working to address tech debt is in the adoption of new technologies and tools. There are always great new products and ideas and technology is so accessible that teams can easily adopt new tools. But sometimes it results in even more money, time and investment to offset vulnerability or consolidate systems that can be properly supported. Our Tech Enablement department is the advocate for careful evaluation of new tools, like adopting a new customer relationship management tool. And most importantly, 100% decommissioning of old tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our cloud initiatives at ATB are a great opportunity for teams to leverage technology, giving team members access to the best machine learning tools, and making systems accessible across platforms and from any location. But we don&rsquo;t want to just move all the problems we&rsquo;ve had and all of the tech debt we&rsquo;ve accumulated into the cloud. We want to solve for the underlying problems simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Even within the cloud, we can look at the problem holistically, protect proprietary and customer data and make sure we are not accumulating unnecessary tech debt.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are strategic in how we tackle our tech debt. Just like consumers, we have have to manage our debt carefully, leverage it in places, make sure we are keeping careful track, and paying it down responsibly.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"30.10.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_768_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_500_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"tech-debt-and-digital-transformation","tags":[{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":9,"title":"IT"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"},{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"}],"labs":[]},{"id":52,"title":"Need More Spark in Your Life?","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/052/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:10","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<h2>So do we.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a general rule, a customer should never know more about a business than one of their customer services reps, but sometimes, sh*t happens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more jarring than accidentally telling someone about a new solution their company offers that even they aren&rsquo;t aware of. And we know it sucks for both sides of the conversation, which is why we always do our best to ensure that every member of the ATB team knows what&rsquo;s up. But the more our company grows, the more challenging it is to maintain the open and efficient lines of communication necessary for swift progress&mdash;and thorough adoption&mdash;to take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In exploring how to tackle this issues, we discovered we need more Spark in our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ATB Sparks are a team strategically assembled to bring together diverse backgrounds and experiences. Their focus? To inspire adoption and accelerate progress&mdash;in other words, to focus on &nbsp;ch@!^g3 management within our squads (yep, change management is a bad word for us!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of change over the years. 10 years ago, we weren&rsquo;t a digital company. In listening to our customers, we&rsquo;re moving from traditional, old-school bank to fintech, and that&rsquo;s left us with a lot of challenges on our hands. We straddle two completely different worlds, with completely different audiences, and we&rsquo;re always striving to honour our foundation while staying timely, efficient, and relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Sparks are deployed&mdash;each into a specific team&mdash;right at the beginning of a project, so that they can understand and maintain focus on the human side by connecting people with the new technologies we roll out on a consistent basis and helping our team members become advocates for transformation. They can also act on behalf of other members of our squads (e.g., learning, communications) so that they can stay focused on their work until a new project is absolutely ready for their input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re both proud and excited to be doing things differently here at ATB. We used to buy our solutions: now we build them. Moving away from a waterfall model and into agile project management has allowed us to get things done in 3-8 weeks instead of the 18 months they used to take. We&rsquo;re working with continuous feedback from our partners, and we&rsquo;re fully prepared to hear when something isn&rsquo;t working. At our size, we can iterate, kill a bad idea fast, and move on&mdash;something our competitors can&rsquo;t do. Sparks are a huge part of this forward motion, because when we make changes, they help those changes reach all 5300 of our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s in it for you? This isn&rsquo;t just a brag about our amazing team. What happens on the inside has an incredible impact on the outside of our company. When we make life smoother and more efficient for our team members, they have more time to return calls and emails, and truly engage with our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our biggest goal in creating the Sparks has been to eliminate information fatigue&mdash;to allow our team members the time and space they need to learn about what&rsquo;s coming down the pipe at ATB, adopt it, experience its value, and share it with you.

All the heads of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their cheque books in tow, ready to settle their scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, as Oil Settlements become electronic, the process acquired new complexities requiring resources, such as reconciling and approvals involving countless humans manually entering in data and double checking contracts all the way along in advance of the big day. Both the energy companies and the banks&mdash;find the process to have become inefficient at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different companies use different internal systems for managing contracts, tracking finances, compliance, and so on. This meant that the entire process of paying out once a month involved people combing over different contracts, manually entering in agreements, and having to decipher one another&#39;s&rsquo; processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now enter blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRANSFORMATION THROUGH TRUST &amp; TRANSPARENCY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since early 2017, ATB and IBM together have built a proof of concept using blockchain that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It no longer matters what internal programs and systems any company in the energy sector uses. It only matters that the agreed upon terms are defined in the blockchain. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including energy companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe the blockchain process will result in 80% of transactions being executed without error and human intervention (as compared to current state). The remaining 20% of transactional volume we anticipate will require &ldquo;human intervention&rdquo;. Even with this conservative estimate, blockchain will enable human capital resources to be optimally re-allocated elsewhere across the value chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to revolutionize such a traditional and large industry such as the oil patch means understanding how that industry&rsquo;s ecosystem works, and involving them in the design and prototyping process. We want the customers to be part of the solutioning so that adoption rates on the other side of the process are high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How ATB addresses solution development and ecosystem adoption is a key part of their journey on all products; as human-centred design is a key internal mandate. As such, working closely with the industry players that experience Oil Settlement Day to ensure they are a key part of the design process is important. This can range from interview to testing to design thinking workshop. People first. Technology next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops provided critical insights into the ecosystem; such as pain points and motivators; culture around priorities and decision making, and more. The conversations shed light on the reality of the vast stakeholders that are engaged in Oil Settlement Day and the need to ensure that a variety of industry players be consulted as part of the blockchain prototype - such as pipeline companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deeper understanding of the ecosystem from the industry&rsquo;s perspective has now guided the steps to expand the needed participants for the MVP development and eventual piloting of the system. Plus, this collaborative process to date means ATB feels confident the Blockchain process it created can provide efficiencies to the energy sector not only in its backyard of Alberta, but across Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BUILDING MORE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past couple of years ATB has been on a journey to build its knowledge and understanding of the capabilities of blockchain, and along the way has managed to begin the development of what it believes will be impactful solutions beyond the oil and gas sector - such as solutions around payment and consumer digital identity. With each, they&rsquo;re engaging ecosystem participants early to help ensure velocity can be maintained as they scale these solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about ATB&rsquo;s approach to innovation, visit &amp; subscribe below!</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"11.12.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"atb-the-value-block-chain-engaging-in-inspired-solution","tags":[{"id":15,"title":"Blockchain"}],"labs":[]},{"id":54,"title":"How to Train Your Robot","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/054/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:12","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<h2>Step one: think like a human</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, our Bot Squad has been busy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly: we&rsquo;ve got a Bot Squad whose work is centred on training software robots to automate banking processes like payments, cash advances, and fee and interest reversals on ATB&rsquo;s Mastercard operations team. The first of those robots is Botson (named by an ATB team member in a contest&mdash;way to go, Myvan!) and we&rsquo;ve just closed in on the end of Phase 1 of training and exploration with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Pepper, Botson is a software robot, which means it doesn&rsquo;t embody a physical robotic form (no labcoat-wearing scientists chasing after a robot with clipboards and stopwatches here!). This type of software is referred to as robotic because it&rsquo;s malleable and can be trained, which is where the Bot Squad comes in. And interestingly, a lot of the training process has us thinking more like humans than robots&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, we initially thought we could train our robot by sitting down, recording the steps necessary to complete a task and then loading them into the robot&rsquo;s software and walking away. What we quickly realized is that completing multiple tasks throughout a day takes a lot more than the basic steps. Because every time a new task arises, it can bring with it a unique set of circumstances. So what Botson needs to be trained on are the exceptions to rules, the &quot;what ifs&quot; and the analysis of multiple outcomes that can be required for a single transaction. In other words, the critical thinking skills our human team members possess in droves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this means is that we need the experts on hand to train Botson&mdash;team members who know the work better than anyone else&mdash;who can quickly identify exceptions that may come up and who can call a spade a spade when it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a robot to complete a certain task. When the robot is suited for a task, it needs to be broken down into small, logical pieces; robots work very well in situations where high volume, short task processes need to be completed. They also do well with highly structured data, and with moving data between systems. Where they need some help is in the more human realm of critical analysis and situational decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucky for us, we have an amazing team of humans to do the human work, so our main goal with robots like Botson is to offload repetitive tasks to the bots to free up time for our highly skilled employees to learn more, innovate, and foster relationships with our clients across Alberta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience thus far with Botson has taught us a lot about how to train a robot. Here are our top three takeaways, should you be planning on training a robot of your own in the near future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about today and tomorrow, and the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; - It&rsquo;s not just about solving today&rsquo;s problems in the realm of robot training. It&rsquo;s also about getting critical about today&rsquo;s problem-solving and how it can be improved, and also about looking forward to what may need solving in the future.<br />\r\nPut on your pessimism hat - Just kidding (mostly). When training a robot, you do need to consider all the ways a task or process can go wrong, however, so that you can them how to deal with all possible outcomes. Spread the love - Once you&rsquo;ve got a robot trained to complete certain tasks, it&rsquo;s helpful to think about other contexts those problem-solving skills could work within. Think about this like getting more robotic bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of all of this is that it&rsquo;s just the beginning. We&rsquo;ve got Botson completing a couple types of tasks, but as we train and iterate its processes, we&rsquo;re already envisioning the significant possibilities of this work, and the significant possibilities it will open up for our human teams to explore, grow and excel.

At ATB, we&rsquo;ve been working with facial recognition&mdash;and other biometric tokens&mdash;to explore the various contexts in which they can offer truly effective and efficient solutions for our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any sort of biometric identification, one of the first questions we hear consistently is about whether or not someone could &ldquo;steal&rdquo; your face and use a photo to trick the system and walk away with all the money in your bank account. The quick answer is no, they couldn&rsquo;t, for a few different reasons. A flat image can&rsquo;t just stand in for a real human face, because facial recognition works by projecting a bitmap onto a user&rsquo;s face to detect various ridges and features. It also bounces random light&mdash;invisible to the human eye&mdash;off its subject to detect things like head movement and identify edges on a photo or phone screen that may be present. The only exception is identical twins, so if you&rsquo;ve got a sibling rivalry going on, you&rsquo;re going to want to take extra precautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the technology being virtually impossible to fool, it&rsquo;s important to remember that your biometric tokens are saved on your smartphone or other mobile device&mdash;and not in some random third party database. So in order for someone to steal your money using facial recognition, for example, they would need to have your account info, your device, and your biometrics. So in other words, you&rsquo;re probably much more likely to get eaten by a shark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we did our biometric testing, we found that touch ID provided the most frictionless experience, following by facial recognition and voice ID. 67% of the people we asked said they would use touch ID, with only 14% saying they would use facial recognition, but it will be very interesting to see how these numbers shift and change the more smartphones and devices start to utilize facial recognition and the more it becomes a part of everyday life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already been testing the use of cameras equipped with facial recognition in some our branches, to explore how we could make our customers&rsquo; experiences even smoother. It&rsquo;s just as much work to pull out your debit card as it is to pull out your smartphone to scan your fingerprint&mdash;these cameras could eliminate the need for either. We ultimately would like to be able to recognize customers as they walk into any of our branches so we can have their account info queued up and we&rsquo;re ready to help the moment they approach our desk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also be supporting facial recognition on our mobile banking app, which, surprisingly, is an incredibly quick and easy system to integrate. On our end, it&rsquo;s essentially a flip of a switch before we&rsquo;re ready to accept facial recognition. The actual wait, of course, will be for all smartphones to integrate facial recognition technology. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll soon be ready for anyone already using it. We&rsquo;re really excited to see what adoption rates and variety of uses will be like moving forward, and we&rsquo;re ready to support, learn, and iterate our own technologies and processes to develop the best solutions possible to make ATB customers&rsquo; lives better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for top talent to work on innovative projects just like this one.

It can also be hard to share information on the internet if you can&rsquo;t trust where it&rsquo;s going to end up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We told you a little bit about blockchain technology and the potential for<a href=\"http://ttps://atbalphabeta.com/articles/71\">&nbsp;identity records,</a> but how can people and organizations actually start using these innovations in real life? It starts with a network, and ATB has been exploring one such network as the first Canadian steward of Sovrin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin is a blockchain network that works by acting as the &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; between facts&mdash;they accept facts about people or places, as well as the verification from another authorized party that those facts are true and trustworthy. For example, in the future, when we all have digital identity records, you could add your new driver&rsquo;s license to your records through Sovrin, and the Government of Alberta could verify that it is, in fact, a real and valid license. From there, you could use your identity record anywhere you need to present ID with the simple scan of a QR code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the fact that this process would be highly efficient and completely trustworthy, it also adds a new level of security to our lives. Consider the number of times you&rsquo;ve had to present your ID just to prove that you&rsquo;re over 18. The person verifying your age, in the process of doing so, has also had access to your full date of birth, your address, your height and weight, etc. Using an identity record would allow a third party to scan a QR code and know&mdash;without doubt&mdash;that you are over 18, without learning anything else about you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refreshing, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why have we become a steward of Sovrin, and what does that actually mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin was founded by Evernym, who quickly realized that in order to truly operate a network of trust, Sovrin needed to be a non-profit organization, separate from any for-profit company. As a foundation with a diverse board of trustees, Sovrin can and does now exist and function without its founding company, and all servers and software required to run the network are provided by stewards for no fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud to be the first Canadian steward, and it&rsquo;s our goal to be the first bank in North America to offer our customers digital identity records. Of course, there are many challenges associated with that goal. As leaders in innovation, ATB gets involved in these sorts of explorations very early on. Sovrin may not be the end all, be all solution, but it&rsquo;s a strong solution and it&rsquo;s allowing us to move forward, which is the direction we&rsquo;re always looking to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being innovators often also presents the challenge of working in a space without a lot of groundwork or foundation. How do we introduce digital identity records to the mass market? How do we ensure our customers feel comfortable and eager to adopt them? And how to we encourage and foster other companies and organizations to start working with digital wallets and a blockchain network? We&rsquo;ve taken all of these questions and thrown them into our sandbox environment, where we&rsquo;re doing a lot of internal testing. We expect this project to go through countless iterations throughout 2018 so that we can make sure the many complexities of the system are dealt with and fully understood before we roll it out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey.

We&rsquo;re also eagerly sharing new tools and technologies with ATB customers through MVP launches, beta tests, and new business lines. And, lucky for us, many of our customers just can&rsquo;t get enough!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core changes in how we do business differently came from a shift in our internal mindset. Adopting a customer obsession and talking to customers about their needs and wants and how they currently use banking tools. For financial institutions, this is a different way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than just a few new rules, we&rsquo;re now playing a fundamentally different game. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our customer obsession, we gathered the team of innovative thinkers and the technology stack to enable us to design and prototype tools to meet those customer needs. Our shift to the cloud and integration of APIs are one of the changes that has allowed us to bring new products to customers with speed and agility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are building for customer needs, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that change isn&rsquo;t hard. We know we have to work constantly to create a state of comfort for our customers and to maintain confidence in our systems and the changes that we make. That means allowing customers to consume just enough to understand. Giving customers control over their experience and assuring them that what they do everyday will still work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, updating a customer tool or the look and feel of an online business banking platform would have had a launch date, with communication plans for educating team members and customers that a new tool was launching. Inevitably, on launch day, customers still feel like it is a change that is done<em> *to* </em>them, and not *<em>for* </em>them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are turning that process around and putting value first. What are people actually doing and how can we make small improvements that will make their life better? By sharing our MVP with groups of customers early and iterating along the path, we actually get to the end stage with a better outcome and also with more value for customers over all. We fix problems when they are at a smaller scale, with 100 or 1,000 users instead of a full launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because online banking tools are key in managing money, we need to make sure customers involved in this journey are confident that we aren&rsquo;t negatively disrupting their process for changes that we can&rsquo;t bring to life rapidly. A key to keeping the confidence of customers in the early testing phase is to give them confidence that it is secure and stable, that they can&rsquo;t break anything, do anything accidentally, or &lsquo;make a mistake.&rsquo; Importantly, the tools we&rsquo;re testing must also have value for them to try it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms - we start off at a very small scale. Our first testers are generally customers who have expressed a specific need. And the testing happens with live systems, not demos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is no alternative to a real experience for a customer with their live account information and actually satisfying a need or completing a task.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We empower our customer to decide what experience they will have. Importantly, they have the option to go back to the old experience. There is no down side for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small steps, user-centred design, and putting customers in charge of their own experience; that is how we are building a base of ATB customers who are willing to change and grow along with us. Avid supporters and enthusiastic beta users. Customers with the same adoption mindset as ATB team members. We may be playing a new game, but our teamwork is stronger than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you an ATB customer interested in beta testing new products?

Although more than 60 thousand people work in the arts and cultural sectors of Alberta (generating over five billion dollars a year), the industry is competitive, cash flows erratic and dreams underfunded. Plus, that &ldquo;break the mould&rdquo; approach to creativity isn&rsquo;t always an understood mindset when it comes to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than ask artists to conform to a bank&rsquo;s view of an ideal customer, banking needs to catch up, step up, and meet the unique needs of artists‒for the greater good of all Albertans. Which is exactly why we&rsquo;re taking a fresh artists-first approach to banking with the ATB Branch for Arts and Culture (or, &quot;The Branch&quot;), launching in Calgary and Edmonton late November.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch will be unlike any other location we&rsquo;ve opened. In fact, you could say we&rsquo;re focused on making it as un-banky as possible&mdash;c&rsquo;mon, not all of us at ATB are &quot;left-brained&quot;. The Branch for Arts and Culture is built by artists (that happen to be expert bankers), for artists. The team working at The Branch are artists themselves, who intimately understand what it&rsquo;s like to live and work creatively, and who will be focused on offering a range of solutions to clients with a range of not-so-typical income streams. Beyond providing customized financial services, The Branch hints at a future as an arts venue, morphing into anything from a concert site to a gallery space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch staff has been talking and listening to artists and creatives to truly understand how we can provide as much support as possible. From workshops for those who need more guidance in their grant applications to a variety of different lending models to connecting our customers with Blue Cross, we know that financial confidence and planning is not as prominent in the arts world as it is in others, and we&rsquo;re on our way to changing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that note, our left brains are already at work helping artists access ATB&rsquo;s alternative financing solutions, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atbboostr.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB BoostR</a>. Our crowdfunding platform allows the village to get directly involved in the journey of a local artist, and also, as a great side benefit, helps us develop new lending and credit models that reflect the lives of creatives. Imagine lending models that include a wider view of credit indicators and take creativity, community and commitment into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that creative-preneurs are important beyond their creative sphere. They&rsquo;re innovators. They help bring about significant economic diversification and can spark big changes to communities by fostering and building a pool of top talent, which leads to catching the eye of top employers, new HQs moving in, and a whole heck of a lot of growth. For us, it&rsquo;s also about putting our money where our mouth is: when we say we&rsquo;re on a mission to transform banking and help all types of entrepreneurs amplify their business, we mean it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCheck out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atb.com/thebranch\" target=\"_blank\">www.atb.com/thebranch</a>&nbsp;for more details.

Banks in other countries are further along.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A look at some of the deployments in three of them &mdash; Israel, Canada and Hong Kong &mdash; could offer ideas and inspiration for those in the early stages, as well as insight into what is working and what is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few takeaways: Bots are not just for millennials, document scanning can be the hardest part, and people are more comfortable asking questions of bots than they are of humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Israel</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank Leumi officially launched the AI-powered, mobile-only bank Pepper in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence lets Pepper provide what CEO Lilach Bar-David calls &ldquo;contextual intelligence.&rdquo; The AI engine analyzes customers&rsquo; transactions, what they are clicking on, how long they stay on specific data elements, and other data points to determine what should appear in each customer&rsquo;s app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes real-time, daily, weekly and monthly spending alerts and customized content including news articles and consumer tips based on the AI engine&rsquo;s growing understanding of what the customer does, wants and responds well to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It takes time &mdash; the more you transact with us, the more we know about you and the more we leverage that data to give you personalized banking,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;So my Pepper and yours won&rsquo;t look the same because the feed will be based on our personal behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper warns customers of potential problems &mdash; for example, if a customer continues to spend at his or her current rate, that customer will have a negative checking account balance by the end of the month. It might also tell the customer it&rsquo;s OK to draw from savings to avoid that negative balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper will eventually be three apps that can be used alone or together, linked with a single sign-on. The Pepper banking app provides access to checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and loans. Pepper Pay, launched in February, allows person-to-person payments. And an investment app is due to launch by early next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, a few hundred thousand users have downloaded the Pepper banking and Pepper Pay apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to help customers better manage their money. The bank conducted several surveys of the &ldquo;global millennials&rdquo; it targets with Pepper and found they were less concerned about fees because they don&rsquo;t know how much they pay anyway, but struggled with lack of knowledge about banking in general and how to develop good personal finance habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early adopters are not who Bank Leumi thought they would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were under the assumption that only millennials would get on board Pepper, but actually, more than half its users are consumers aged 35 and above,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;It makes me think we&rsquo;re reaching people with millennials&rsquo; state of mind more than an age.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is developing 24/7 human customer service for all three apps over voice, video and chat. When the customer starts a call or chat, agents will know who the customer is and what they have been doing; the AI engine will try to predict their questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, customers really like the video chat; they use it to help them navigate the eight-minute sign-up process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest part of onboarding, Bar-David said, has been having the app read information from the ID documents correctly in Hebrew. The workaround is to let people take pictures of their IDs and then type in the details from their phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because design is important &mdash; &ldquo;When they join a bank that&rsquo;s only mobile, consumers compare you to Facebook, Google; the expectations are sky high,&rdquo; Bar-David said &mdash; the bank hired 150 employees, many from tech startups, to create the mobile apps. It worked with the strategy design firm Designit on the apps&rsquo; look and feel, including a custom-made font. The core is Temenos&rsquo; software, selected for its affordability so Bank Leumi can pass those lower costs on to customers, Bar-David said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper is being given time before it is required to produce a return on an investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;On the one hand, it&rsquo;s a strategic move for Leumi,&rdquo; Bar-David explained. &ldquo;They did it because they believe disruption is needed and consumers expect a dramatically better experience in the banking industry. On the other hand, we didn&rsquo;t build a bank for fun. It has to be in the end a bank that&rsquo;s profitable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Canada, RBC launched a Personetics-based virtual assistant including financial guidance and automated savings features in September. TD Bank embedded an AI chatbot that uses Kasisto&rsquo;s Kai software in its mobile banking app in early October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another large Canadian regional bank, ATB Financial, launched an AI virtual assistant for Facebook Messenger using Finn.ai&rsquo;s technology in late October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comfort factor</strong><br />\r\nPeople are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being, says Wellington Holbrook of ATB Financial in Canada. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook he says.<br />\r\nThough other banks, including Wells Fargo, Citi and TD Ameritrade, have Facebook Messenger bots, ATB says it is the first in the world to offer full-featured banking through Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always thinking of new ways to creatively compete with much larger competitors: How do we bring better service to our customers, how do we compete on scale?&rdquo; said Wellington Holbrook, chief transformation officer at the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For financial institutions like ours, [a virtual assistant is] a bit of an evening of the playing field,&rdquo; Holbrook said. &ldquo;When you consider the complexity of bringing a lot of different services to our customers through traditional channels, it&rsquo;s very people intensive, very cost intensive, and we&rsquo;re at a disadvantage in terms of our relative size. The virtual assistant is an equalizer for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year ago, Jake Tyler, CEO of Finn.ai, and his team approached Holbrook to suggest ways the bank could provide more modern experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The virtual assistant creates a departure from the traditional ways of thinking about banking, to a much more modern way of thinking that has more in common with the way you interact with other types of organizations or your peer groups as a consumer,&rdquo; Tyler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This increasingly means providing banking services through third-party platforms like Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finn.ai, Tyler said, lets people do about 80% of their banking activities in a Facebook Messenger bot. Customers can pay bills, pay friends and transfer money between accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time that full featured functionality has been available&quot; within Facebook Messenger, Tyler said. &ldquo;We thought it was important to do core banking activity for customers as the foundation for an assistant that will be useful to them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a spending insight feature of which customers can ask questions like, &ldquo;What did I spend at Starbucks?&rdquo; or &ldquo;When is my Mastercard bill due?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB and Finn.ai are working to make the bot more helpful, so beyond telling customers when their bills are due, the bot might make sure they have enough money in their accounts to pay them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any question the bot cannot answer gets passed to human agents at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In testing the virtual assistant, Holbrook observed the same thing Darrius Jones has noticed in USAA&rsquo;s use of Clinc&rsquo;s AI-based Amazon Alexa Skill: People are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holbrook&rsquo;s biggest aspiration for the bot is to make it easier for customers to bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The banking industry has been focused for a long time on driving efficiencies, making banking work better for us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the revolution of smart devices, we haven&rsquo;t kept up with making experiences better for our customers. We see this as the beginning of ways we&rsquo;re going to use tech to help customers make more out of their time, and create more happiness in their lives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Hong Kong</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest noteworthy announcement of a customer-facing AI implementation is Standard Chartered Bank, which is based in London but has a presence in 68 countries. In mid-November, the company said it planned to deploy a chatbot on its online and mobile banking platforms using Kasisto&#39;s conversational artificial intelligence platform, KAI Banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chatbot will help clients manage money, make payments and analyze their spending via natural conversations in English and other languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to take the bot live first in Hong Kong next year in English (subject to regulatory approval), then gradually deploy worldwide in multiple languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is not ready to talk about the technology yet, but Zor Gorelov, Kasisto&#39;s CEO, said his company is teaching KAI Banking about Hong Kong regulatory rules and banking practices, as well as about Standard Chartered products to prepare for the rollout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is also teaching the software to speak &ldquo;Chinglish&rdquo; in text and voice communications: Sometimes people will start a sentence in one language and finish it in another, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai already understands much of the banking terminology used in different parts of the world, Gorelov said. For instance, it knows that &ldquo;current account,&rdquo; &ldquo;CA&rdquo; and &ldquo;checking account&rdquo; all mean the same thing. It knows that &ldquo;FD,&rdquo; &ldquo;fixed deposit&rdquo; and &ldquo;certificate of deposit&rdquo; are different ways of describing the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re learning everyday here at ATB and looking for insights anywhere we can.

We must evaluate risk and analyze how suitable a process is for automation - this requires human judgement, reasoning, and compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But yet, there are plenty of processes that are ripe for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At ATB, we&rsquo;re not afraid of working alongside automation, because we know how much value our (human) team members provide to each other and to customers. Our team members offer, through judgment, the ability to listen and engage - things our bots or any AI we implement just can&rsquo;t provide. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we evaluate and implement intelligent process automation, we use a customer focussed lens to identify and prioritize projects. By focusing on customers, we&rsquo;ve identified over 50 processes to tackle through a combination of streamlining and end-to-end intelligent automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal: to disrupt the customer experience and reduce manual work required by team members, allowing them to focus on the value of human interaction (and eliminating potential for common human faults, such as typos or inconsistencies in data entry). By leaning into intelligent process automation technology, we get to continually live up to our tagline &ldquo;Banking Made Simple.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation means that we can: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Reduce risk</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Think of a simple form of automation: automatic vehicle lights. For decades, a human had to turn on the lights when it got dark. Automation removes the human factor of this clear binary decision. When the sensor detects dim light, a switch flips and the headlights turn on - no possibility for human error, and reduced risk of accidents due to impaired visibility on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Similarly, processes like account suspension based on fraudulent activity benefit greatly from the combination of high-powered real-time data monitoring. Automation then carries out tasks between different internal systems based on data inputs and structured rules.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Even updating customer information such as addresses can be a tedious task because team members must go into numerous different systems depending on the products that the customer has with ATB. Process automation, combined with data validation on the inputs, eliminates the risk of errors and reduces overall manual work for our team members so they can work on what they do best.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Work smarter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As a human race, we&rsquo;ve levelled up in terms of our intelligence and achievements. We&rsquo;ve historically used tools to augment our abilities, and now computing power and technology have put information at our fingertips. We&rsquo;ve moved from needing to know <em>how to do</em> math to needing to know <em>how to use</em> a calculator to input your problem, for example. Now, we are taking this one step further and moving into a stage where a computer can actually identify both the problem and the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>ATB is an organization that offers a diverse set of products and services. Therefore, we have a lot of systems and processes in place that don&rsquo;t always talk to each other. What robotic process automation allows us to do is create value for our customers by enabling the connection of all of these processes. Problem &rarr; Solution.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Save money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Working more efficiently is always a key priority in business. Anywhere that we can streamline process and improve how we work provides value to our customers and stakeholders. Thus, robotic process automation allows us to streamline process without investing in new systems and means we can service our clients faster.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>We are also living in an interesting time where technology has become more democratized. Computing power is not only increasing at an exponential rate. That power is also becoming accessible at a much lower price point. Improvements to hardware and the rise of cloud computing make it possible for any organization to employ better technology at a lower investment than ever before.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Provide more value</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much opportunity to augment human knowledge and decision-making by leveraging technology in banking. We can be smarter about giving advice to customers, and about fulfilling customer requests. We can move information faster and more seamlessly. Rather than aiming for 100% automated processes, we are working toward 100% value-added work from our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining the power of technology and the skills of our team members enables us to enhance the ATB experience. Whether you prefer to find answers to your banking questions on your own or by speaking with one of our team members, process automation and technologies such as artificial intelligence allow us to deliver a great customer experience every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to robotics software, we leverage enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing to optimize our processes end-to-end. AI can help us better capture what the customer needs (but not feel like they are interacting with a robot), and from there, robotic process automation can execute the process to fulfill their request. Eventually, machine learning and using robots as a service will allow us to build on these solutions and integrate more of our core processes or third-party applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s so magical about process automation is its ability to drastically change the customer experience without huge investment in back-end systems. We&rsquo;re not afraid of a future where error-prone repetitive tasks are handled by robots and our human team members can spend their time providing value to ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscribe below or join the team at <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">careers.atbalphabeta.com</a>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"28.11.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/064/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/064/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"robots-aren-t-taking-our-jobs-how-robotic-process-automation-helps-improve-customer-service","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":5,"title":"Robotics"},{"id":6,"title":"Automation"},{"id":4,"title":"AI"}],"labs":[]},{"id":62,"title":"From Academia to AI - the pivot.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/062/article_image.jpg","date":"15.11.2018 22:19","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":true,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p><strong>Many academics are finding new career paths in applying theoretical expertise to the exploding field of AI and machine learning. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we sat down with Mark Sebestyen, a mathematician turned ATB data scientist to ask about what short advice he has for scientists who want to make the transition to the applied world of ML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For researchers with advanced degrees in mathematics, physics, statistics, and computer engineering, moving from theoretical and research applications to the world outside academia opens a world of beauty and passion as theoretical knowledge finds valuable applications in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is huge value in having AI and machine learning teams made up of members from enormously diverse backgrounds.

We are really strong in this domain already and it is only going to grow as great minds flock to the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For academics and those studying advanced degrees in technical areas or for those who have made the career transition to apply their expertise to AI and machine learning already here are a few pieces of advice:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Be informed about the world at large - it gives you ideas of how to apply novel ideas in your context. <strong>Go beyond theoretical applications to make the connection with the real world.</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Find a sub-domain in your area that you want to become the best at and keep your focus narrow. </strong>Don&rsquo;t try to be an expert in all things - know your limitations and have deep understanding in your speciality, awareness of what you don&rsquo;t know, and an open mind to how your expertise can apply to other topics. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Keep the curiosity going, get comfortable being uncomfortable and exploring outside your expertise area.</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB and across the AI and machine learning ecosystem in Alberta, we need to be bold and own the knowledge and expertise that we have and to own the solutions to demonstrate to the world the good that can be done with AI and machine learning. We are looking to bring together experts from across fields to create novel solutions and leverage the power of AI for the good of Albertans and the world.

You walk into your neighbourhood ATB where you&rsquo;re greeted by Pepper the robot. She scans your fingerprint and you tell her you&rsquo;re ready to get your first mortgage. She directs you to a customer experience rep whose computer&mdash;based on your fingerprint and vocal recognition&mdash;has already pulled up your identity record, complete with a recent photo, address, credit history and biometric tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting you up with your mortgage is quick and frictionless&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need for long approval processes and credit checks. This identity record is stamped with the date it was created, and also contains a list of notes and additions you&rsquo;ve made to it since birth. Everywhere you go, you&rsquo;re able to securely update this identity record, and every time you do, your new information is instantly passed on to the organizations you&rsquo;ve authorized to see it. Your identity, belongs to you, and only you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t some lofty dream of the year 3000. It&rsquo;s a dream we have of the not-so-distant future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with blockchain as the technological backbone to Bitcoin. The name is self-explanatory once you understand how the technology works. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin blockchain groups all transactions that have taken place during that time frame, puts them through an algorithm, and adds that group&mdash;or block&mdash;to a chain of other transaction blocks. Each block in the chain refers to the previous block, which refers to the previous block, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes blockchain technology so appealing is its level of security. Blockchain&rsquo;s algorithms are incredibly difficult to hack, and with Bitcoin you only have a 10-minute window in which to try. After that point, a new block of transactions is created and you can&rsquo;t change a single block without the waterfall effect of the system being completely broken down. You would have to communicate your hacked block changes to every single computer in the Bitcoin network. With a distributed leger system in place (i.e., copies of transactions existing on thousands of computers), it would be essentially impossible to communicate that quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, in many ways, blockchain systems like the one developed for Bitcoin may seem like the last place banks would want to get involved, because the system itself diminishes the need for an intermediary (i.e., a bank) to be present for security reasons. The trust required to complete a transaction securely is built into the system&mdash;the system&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the trust provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we&rsquo;ve found in blockchain systems, however, is not a fear of our own demise, but significant opportunities to make our customers&rsquo; lives better in so many ways, starting with banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of last year, we sent money from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BMxnHQGy4\" target=\"_blank\">Canada to Germany using a blockchain system</a>&nbsp;called Ripple. Typically, a transaction like this would take a few hours to complete. This one took eight seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many Albertans have family around the world. And sending money home can be a huge risk. Cost and safety are major issues. Ripple&mdash;or a future system similar to it &mdash;could negate these issues by depositing funds directly into a bank or cell phone account in seconds. No need to coordinate time zones for phone calls and ID verification. No need for your loved ones to anxiously carry cash home. Just an easy few seconds and a definite boost of happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not stopping at international transactions. We want to explore the possibility of creating secure digital identities that individuals have complete control over in a highly secure system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&rsquo;re certainly not ready to set up your identity record tomorrow, we&rsquo;re fully prepared to figure out how we can create this transformative experience for our customers and lead the way on what we consider one of the most exciting and impactful uses of the blockchain system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think of all the places your identity is currently stored. Rather than 10-20 different organizations having their own version of your identity, you could go through life with one consistent record, that you completely control, granting other parties access to it when necessary&mdash;to open a bank account, get a car loan or be approved for your first mortgage.&nbsp;</strong>This is the future ATB is exploring, with the help of blockchain technology. And our starting point is, of course, making banking work for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to be part of a team intentionally building for the future?

And then again when you return from lunch. And a coffee break. And when you need to zip out and grab something for dinner.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are you exhausted just thinking about it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The best kind of architecture is that which provides you with fewer hurdles to overcome in order to get to your destination, plus having a solid foundation you can build upon in the future. The result: agility, responsiveness and speed, without having to rethink the foundation each and every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been running ATB using an overly complex and resource-intensive Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) layer for a long time. That means that if we make changes to one element in our banking system, it impacts a significant number of other elements - forcing us to basically do an obstacle course through our own architecture. Think of it this way - if a service calls for XYZ, our ESB can provide ABC, but it has to hop over D-K and crawl under M-R before it can final go straight fromXYZ. This makes it complex to work with, not only for us, but for any third parties who require access to our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, our technological architecture has been slowing us down, so it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve teamed up with the most experienced mobile technologies team in the market: IBM. Together, we&rsquo;ve built a digital lab where we&rsquo;re working on a very exciting new architecture for ATB. There are no lab coats here. Just some of the greatest minds from both IBM and ATB, creating a system that could entirely change the way we provide banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest changes we&rsquo;re working towards is our project approach. We&rsquo;re leaving the waterfall approach to system architecture behind and focusing on faster technologies and methodologies. Rather than making a change to the system and having to wait to see if it&rsquo;ll have a negative impact on the whole system, we can work very quickly&mdash;think deploying a new feature in one month instead of eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if that feature doesn&rsquo;t work as planned? The system works both ways: we can fail fast and fix it fast, allowing ATB to be incredibly adaptable in a world where technologies are constantly changing. Does that sound like the type of place where you can succeed? Check out our<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;open positions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This adaptability isn&rsquo;t due only to ditching the waterfalls&mdash;we&rsquo;re taking a leap far ahead of other banks and moving to an agnostic and highly scalable system. One which allows us to adopt and adapt third-party APIs, quickly bringing them to our customers through strategic partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can look forward to our first release with this approach&mdash;for mobile&mdash;around the end of the year. But remember, this is an ongoing journey. Internally, we&rsquo;re looking at new releases to existing platforms every couple weeks, so there&rsquo;s lots more to come. What we&rsquo;re hoping though, is that the technology gets so good it disappears. So...in all likelihood, you may not notice our back of house changes because things work as expected. And that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x1194\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"06.12.2017","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"don-t-go-chasing-waterfalls","tags":[{"id":16,"title":"Data"},{"id":6,"title":"Automation"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"}],"labs":[]},{"id":61,"title":"Transforming how we work: our journey to the cloud","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/061/article_image.jpg","date":"15.11.2018 22:18","facets":["progress","business"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;ve been sharing the story of our G Suite adoption far and wide. And one of the questions we get often is &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t it disruptive?&rsquo; - the answer is yes, and that&rsquo;s what we were going for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As technology makes leaps forward, the next generation of consumers, and workers will be almost immune to OS updates and new product launches. Similarly, organizations large and small don&rsquo;t need to adopt latest and greatest technology, they need to learn to continually embrace change and disrupt themselves. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our transition to G Suite, we did not take the perspective of technology change or upgrade, but rather looked at it as an opportunity to look at how and why we do things, and really reimagine how we work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was more than simply moving files to the cloud, or copying formulas from an old spreadsheet to a Google Sheet, we approached the transition to G Suite as an opportunity to question everything about how we work. Asking &lsquo;does this provide value to customers? And &lsquo;how might we do this better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits of our transformation are much more than simply new tools, it is about a new mindset. For example, in our old mindset, team members would work on a document until completion before sending for comments, receiving feedback and then compiling. In our new mindset, we have adopted to a &nbsp;&lsquo;co-authoring&rsquo; approach where docs are shared from the outset, often before they are &lsquo;ready.&rsquo; This results in deeper and faster collaboration, but it is also an example of our changed perspective on genuine collaboration and vulnerability as individuals and as an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey to the cloud has been exciting and rewarding, so we want to share some of the highlights that enabled us to transform the way we work on our mission to empower team members to reimagine banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let the story guide you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.atb.com/about/Pages/our-story.aspx\">ATB story</a> is a guiding narrative for everything we do. Ultimately we want to create customer happiness. On our path to get there, we have the specific intention to make time richer. A goal that permeates every level of the organization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo when our G Suite transition team was evaluating how much email history to migrate to the cloud, the ultimate answer came down to valuing the time of our team members. Rather than encouraging staff to do a &lsquo;spring cleaning&rsquo; of their email, or asking them to manage with only 30 or 45 days of their email history during the transition, we made the choice to migrate our entire email history. When it came down to &lsquo;making their time richer,&rsquo; the decision was a no-brainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Forget &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizational change often comes with a scheduled &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; and a project plan that works backwards from that, with milestones and communication to staff members to keep them informed and to prime them for the big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did away with that entirely and essentially rolled out the G Suite to waves of early adopters. <strong>In the end, we had nearly 15% of the company as early adopters and teams were begging to have the full roll out so that the tools were available to all members. When &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; finally came, it was pretty much a non-event.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The psychological safety that came from having &lsquo;optional&rsquo; adoption, experts and gurus, and building excitement meant that they didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a change being inflicted on them when the time came. There was also no expectations that team members would become experts day one. Rather, as the organization moved through the transition, team members would grow to adopt and master the tools available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Self-select the leaders</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many organization, leadership would select team members to be seconded to special transformational projects. The G Suite launch team said no-way to that and instead we opted for self-selection, letting team members from across the organization apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was having a 50 person team known as the G Evangelists that were interested, passionate, and all-in to lead the charge. It also resulted in enormous diversity, pulling in everyone from branch team members from rural locations to managing directors from head office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It was extremely valuable to bring in the different perspectives of all teams who would be affected by the change and it was especially important that team members &lsquo;checked their titles at the door&rsquo; meaning that all team members were heard and valued for their diverse perspectives. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The self-selection process also was a great professional development opportunity for team members who might not otherwise have been exposed to the challenge. More than half of the G Suite adoption team ended up in different parts of the organization after being exposed to the change and showing their great skills and leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get executive on board </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem to make sense to leave the transition of the executive team to the end, making sure that all the kinks are worked out and that all of their staff are already on the new system. We took a bit of a different approach, giving &lsquo;white-glove&rsquo; service to our executives and their teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a real explosion point for our adoption, executives begging for more team members to be added to the adoption team, as they started seeing immense value in the tools. G+ communities, live video broadcasts, and competitions gave our staff access to executive team members like they had never had before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let team members guide themselves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you politely tell someone to &lsquo;Google it themselves?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of multi-hour training session and a dedicated help-desk, we wanted to enable peer-to-peer learning and let the organization support itself. We used G Suite tools and ingenuity to connect team members to support each other. For example, we had G Guides who acted as roaming support, looking for team members who might need help and for team members who couldn&#39;t find a G guide, we had physical signs at the desks of G Whizzes - indicating team members near you in the office who might have answers to your questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also saw enormous uptake of G+ communities - threads like &ldquo;Hey, did you know&rdquo; where people shared exciting features or capabilities that they discovered. And &ldquo;How do I&hellip;&rdquo; chats where team members can troubleshoot for each other, share expertise, and alleviate the need for dedicated experts and support teams. A storyteller collective also allowed team members to share stories of success and transformation to continue to excite and inspire others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of spending time doing in-person training sessions, we ran labs, inspired by the <a href=\"https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage\">Google Garage</a>, where, instead of technical lessons, we helped teams completely reimagine how they do their work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re fully on G Suite collaborating like rock-stars but, even more importantly, we&rsquo;re more ready than ever as individuals and an organization to adapt to changes that we know are coming our way. Ready to react, and not afraid to disrupt ourselves. Come along with us as we explore the future of banking and create happiness for Albertans.

No more &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; someone into defined channels (like bank branches, websites, and mobile apps). We&rsquo;re moving toward a new breed of banking that is conveniently intertwined with one&rsquo;s day-to-day life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In partnership with Finn.ai, we&rsquo;re thrilled to be the first bank in Canada to be working toward launching a banking chatbot. When it&rsquo;s live, you&rsquo;ll be able to text the chatbot through Facebook Messenger, asking it to perform different types of transactions. From&nbsp;<em>Interac</em>&nbsp;e-Transfers<em>,&nbsp;</em>to bill payments, and viewing transaction histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to integrate the chatbot with the Facebook Messenger platform because, so far, it&rsquo;s one of the only text-based platforms that&rsquo;s allowing outside bot APIs to develop new technology. Luckily it&rsquo;s a platform lots of people are comfortable using, and one of the most used phone apps driving a significant amount of user behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is made possible through a specific form of AI called Natural Language Processing. It allows the chatbot to learn from its own mistakes, bettering its ability to understand customer requests and respond accordingly over time. It&rsquo;s not perfect (yet), but it does provide a new way to bank where, when and how you want, and we&rsquo;re pretty optimistic about the chatbot&rsquo;s learning capacity when it comes to our long term project goals. We believe transactional capabilities are just table stakes for the much wider applications of a true Virtual Banking Assistant. The future of this will be much more like the movie&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;and much less like having a bank teller in your pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chatbots are new to banking, but not to people. Companies like Domino&rsquo;s have built chatbots you can text to order pizza. Pizza is pretty innocuous, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a big deal if the fact that you order pizza twice a week &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; to everyone you know. It&rsquo;s a bigger deal if it&rsquo;s your bank account info becomes public. So even though we&rsquo;re the first to integrate a banking chatbot into Facebook, we want to make sure we&rsquo;re refining toward a seamless and safe experience for users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re iterating our authentication module daily, and pairing technology with education. We&rsquo;ll focus on sharing best practices with users around device and information protection because you can never be too safe. The biggest risk happens when money moves out of an account&mdash;for that reason, we&rsquo;ve employed &ldquo;friendly money movement&rdquo; for our chatbot banking services, which restricts customers to transactions involving accounts that have already been set up and approved for the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Facebook Messenger is our first step, it&rsquo;s certainly not the only one. Beyond this social media chatbot, we&rsquo;re already exploring voice activation so that we can move into accessing the bot through systems like Siri, Google Home and Alexa.

It&rsquo;s why one of our main focal points has always and will always be customer education and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID login on all of our apps, and we use retinal ID to serve the Boyle Street community in Edmonton, many of whom are homeless and can&rsquo;t get a bank account without traditional ID (more on this in September!). Now, we&rsquo;re looking to take things much further. Voice and facial recognition across multiple channels are the next stops on our road map. We&rsquo;re envisioning a future where our call centre instantly connects you to your account info upon hearing you say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and enabling you to do your banking through your smart home or car.

Unlike your thumbprint or retinas, there&rsquo;s a lot that can interfere with voice recognition (street noise, laryngitis, etc.), and your face shape and appearance could change drastically from year to year depending on how life is treating you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our greatest barrier, however, is the imagination, and not technology. The fears surrounding biometrics have been interesting, to say the least. Many fear having their faces and fingerprints stolen&mdash;by way of a sharp cleaver to the wrist. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that we&rsquo;re not storing a photo gallery of facial scans and thumbprints. In fact, there are no images at all&mdash;just digital translations of your face, voice, and fingerprints on a database. Long story short, it&rsquo;d be much easier for someone to save your profile photo and throw it into Face Swap than hack our system. While possible, it would require next level skills and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As strong as biometrics are, two-factor authentication would always be in play: your device&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>a biometric token. Never&nbsp;<em>either or</em>. And despite increased security, there&rsquo;s no increased friction. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your phone. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your fingerprints. You do the math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond transporting you into your favourite sci-fi film, biometrics could continue to make significant social strides, especially when it comes to the underbanked: those who may not have the standard tools or resources required for traditional banking (things like ID or a stable mailing address). As we&rsquo;re learning through our work with Boyle Street, using biometric identification to help individuals secure their funds despite not having access to other basic services is potentially a game changer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about technology for technology&rsquo;s sake. It&rsquo;s about mapping the right tools to the right application to solve the right problems to make banking&mdash;and life&mdash;better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining our ATB transformation team?

Supporting entrepreneurs &nbsp;is something we&rsquo;re really passionate about at ATB, from building entrepreneur centres, to crowdfunding/crowdlending platforms and an accelerator program. Now we&rsquo;re working on something that&rsquo;ll allow entrepreneurs in Alberta to access quality talent from their computer or mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, we launched a pilot of ATB Gigs: a way to connect Alberta business owners with people who can help them get stuff done. If it sounds really simple, that&rsquo;s because it is. We want entrepreneurs to be focused on the important stuff, and in order to do that, we know there&rsquo;s a lot of other work that has to come off their plates. But hiring a full-time employee isn&rsquo;t always the answer. Beyond the fact that paying another full salary may be out of reach, chances are entrepreneurs need help in a lot of different branches of their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s data entry, copywriting, event planning, emails, phone calls or folding promotional t-shirts for their next charity event, entrepreneurs can log into ATB Gigs, create a gig, and wait for the applications to pour in. For now, we&rsquo;ve got a pool of students who have gone through an extensive hiring process waiting to perform gigs, but eventually we plan to expand to others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our biggest focuses is on making this program valuable to everyone involved. The &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; can definitely become a race to the bottom, and we don&rsquo;t plan to let that happen on our watch. Yes, there are a lot of people who can perform tasks online for incredibly low (and potentially unethical) rates; tasks at ATB Gigs are performed by and for Albertans, and we&rsquo;re committed to providing a living wage as the bottom floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, we want to make sure that business owners are confident in the people they&rsquo;re hiring to perform gigs. Our talent goes through a high calibre screening before they&rsquo;re able to accept and perform gigs. And similar to other platforms like Airbnb, ATB Gigs will rely greatly on a ratings and review system to provide honest opinions before entrepreneurs click the &ldquo;hire&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still a lot details for us to fine tune before the official launch, with variables we&rsquo;d like to test along the way. For instance, we&rsquo;re exploring a system to put a portion of students&rsquo; pay directly into savings or investment, while also making sure the platform offers a life-changing solution to business owners. One that allows them to customize the hiring process and think about their business in an entirely new way and find unique and efficient ways our ATB Gigs team can truly help the days flow better. One that can even work as an HR &lsquo;testing&rsquo; tool, allowing business owners to &ldquo;trial run&rdquo; an employee, so to speak, before choosing to bring them on full-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever entrepreneurs can dream up for their business, we want to be there to help.

What you may not know is that while she seems pretty simple on the outside, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to Pepper than meets the eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing we get asked a lot is what it&rsquo;s like to work with a robot. The completely honest answer is that it depends on her software. When she first arrived with her basic software, Pepper liked to answer questions about herself in a cute and funny manner. When we reprogrammed her, however, to focus on banking and a set of very specific tasks, a bit of her whimsy faded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let that get you down, though. Pepper isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; by any stretch of the imagination. We&rsquo;ve been learning so much about her, where she works best, and how she interacts with you (and vice versa) and iterating her software based on those learnings. Quite fittingly, one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned people prefer a polite robot; &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we work on improving Pepper&rsquo;s manners (and gradually moving her towards AI&mdash;something we&rsquo;ll elaborate on later), we&rsquo;re focusing on putting her to work in new contexts that aren&rsquo;t always based in our branch network. We think Pepper would be very helpful in situations where people need financial info but can&rsquo;t necessarily access it. Places like showhomes, where visitors may need to know more about how mortgages work, have their finances assessed, or get approved for a mortgage, or at university welcome weeks, where new post-secondary students may need to learn more about accounts or loans. We also want to test her out with creative entrepreneurs, so we&rsquo;re sending her to the Vignettes Design Series in Edmonton to meet with artists, designers, and other creatives and educate them about our upcoming arts and culture branch. When things get complicated, Pepper will always be accompanied by a human who can take over as required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it may sound like a lot, this phase of work with Pepper is actually quite short and sweet, and it&rsquo;s important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t a situation where you can judge a book by its cover. What you see in Pepper today, or tomorrow, or next week, isn&rsquo;t what you get. It&rsquo;s her insides&mdash;her software&mdash;that hold the real magic, and we&rsquo;re working furiously to get her to where she needs to be. One of the coolest parts about working with Pepper is that we don&rsquo;t actually know where she&rsquo;ll end up.&nbsp;<strong>The research is dictating the path over time, and every use case we test becomes either a building block or another step in the process of elimination.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while working with a robot may not be as cinematic as you think&mdash;sitting in a lab together having in-depth conversations with Pepper while various engineers connect wires to her, etc., etc.&mdash;we think she should definitely stay on your radar, because much is yet to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for talented people to join us on our journey.

You might be living in poverty. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have a safe place to sleep. Maybe &lsquo;home&rsquo; is an elusive concept instead of a place to go. You might be struggling with mental health challenges or addiction. All of these points of vulnerability could result in a situation where it&rsquo;s difficult to obtain - let alone hang onto - proper identification. And without identification, a safe place to keep the money that you do have isn&rsquo;t possible. For many in our community, this is their reality and a bank account - an opportunity to keep their money safe and grow their wealth - becomes a figment of the imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that access to banking is a basic right. With that guiding philosophy, enter Four Directions Financial, one way we&rsquo;re helping those in the Edmonton community that are vulnerable access banking, know that their money is safe, and maintain their pride and dignity. Part of ATB&rsquo;s agency network, Four Directions Financial is located next to Boyle Street Community Services, which has been serving inner-city Edmonton since 1971. We partnered in 2016, combining our financial and technological know-how with Boyle Street&rsquo;s expertise in supporting those in poverty, to provide vulnerable people access to mainstream financial services, often for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you walk inside the Boyle Street Community Services building, it looks like any other bank. But instead of requiring traditional ID, which is often lost or stolen, clients of this location can quickly and easily verify their identity through biometrics. As the first financial institution in Alberta to use biometric identification technology and the first in Canada to apply this technology to the underbanked, we use a simple, yet powerful black box to scan clients&rsquo; fingerprints and irises. Sixty-five per cent of Four Directions Financial&rsquo;s clients are registered to access their accounts through biometric identification. Others take advantage of Boyle Street&rsquo;s ID program (they use Boyle Street&rsquo;s address as their home address and then Boyle Street keeps the ID safe for them onsite).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to biometric technology, other unique features of Four Directions Financial include daily restrictions on withdrawals that are set by the customer, direct deposit of government cheques, and making the agency open to everyone&ndash;not just clients at Boyle Street.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With less time spent verifying IDs, more time is left for conversation. Marg, the Manager at Four Directions, knows many of her 520 customers by name. She spends time talking to clients about their lives and provides customized financial advice. Four Directions Financial merges relationship-based banking with cutting-edge technology. This affords hundreds of vulnerable people a safe place to store their money and take control of their finances. One-third of people who use Four Directions now have money left in their account at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work with biometrics extends beyond Four Directions - we&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID on all our apps and that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Upcoming advances include passive biometric solutions. We&rsquo;re currently conducting a proof of concept at the ATB Campus with facial recognition as a potential replacement for employee access cards, with a view to expanding to our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As technology evolves, so too must our approach and application of it. After all, what good is transformation when it doesn&rsquo;t make life better for those of us that need it the most? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want a job that makes meaningful impacts on peoples&#39; lives?

That customer-centricity is at the heart of our mission, our strategy and our bottom line - as is a core driver to deliver happiness and provide value beyond banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it only makes sense that, in our mission to transform banking by leveraging new and emerging technologies, we look to how these technologies evolve our fundamental customer experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brain Lab, an initiative of ATB Leap&rsquo;s innovation lab, was created to take a research-based approach to exploring the relationships between technology, neurology, and psychology. Led by Dr. Trudi Chalmers, a Behavioural Neuroscientist and leader at ATB, The Brain Lab will utilize the efficiencies of Electroencephalogram (EEG) Machines to interpret activity in the brain associated with technology interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Areas of research for the Lab will include: Fundamental Research, Product Interfaces, Performance &amp; Wellness, and Physical Meets Digital - all through the power of brain activity data procured from EEG testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fundamental Research</strong> is the foundation of the lab: Brain Data. Curating extensive secondary research published by institutions (such as The University of Calgary), coupled with the production of The Brain Lab&rsquo;s own data, we will create the data infrastructure required to support and validate the accompanying research areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Interfaces</strong> will explore the opportunities in beneficial, affective computing with digital products used in market today. We believe we can create metrics for intuitive digital design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring published literature, existing psychological and sociological data, social media, ATB&#39;s existing databases, and primary neuroscientific and psychophysiological data, we&rsquo;ll be able to more deeply understand how our brain and mind respond to both internal and external stimuli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance &amp; Wellness</strong> recognizes a priority for sustained brain health for our team members and customers. We believe the future of work and products will include the importance of environments where people can engage in their most impactful, happy mental states - and understand potential impacts of product utilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s well established that the use of technology can have some significant impacts on the brain - a fact many who regularly use smartphones can likely attest. Yet, as the rate of innovation increases exponentially, we intend to research how these emerging technologies will impact us in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Physical meets Digital </strong>will begin to create the agnostic product architecture required for changes in digital interfaces - and perhaps prepare us for a world of brain-computer interfaces, and the future of the IoT (Internet of Things).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By pulling back the layers on our interactions with our technology, we can begin to isolate and test impacts of our own products on the brain health of our customers, while also gleaning insights to inform future neural modeling that can scale past the human experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of scientific insight and transformational technologies, we can evolve our commitment to the mental wellbeing of customers and team members, while informing future work in the ATB AI lab. The Brain Lab will be closely linked to our AI Lab, ensuring the findings, data, and ethical considerations are closely woven into development of emerging technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there is ongoing debate around whether Artificial Intelligence Networks can be modeled off of the human brain, we believe deeply understanding our own human networks and interpretations of learning is the most efficient place to start. This is just the beginning of a long line of experiments aimed at helping us better understand the human brain, and the emotions, behaviours and actions that make us who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we embrace digital transformation at ATB, we have a responsibility to our customers to be mindful of the impact of our products and services, right down to a neural level. With every new product or service, we want to know we&rsquo;re aligned in our mission to positively impact our customers&rsquo; lives; precisely, in a way that we can measure and evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our mission?

The application of deep reinforcement learning that was famously used for solving games like <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/\">Atari</a> with defined rules and bounds is being applied by our team of researchers to effectively turn &lsquo;banking&rsquo; into a closed game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star of zero dissatisfied customers, our AI Lab is finding novel, real world applications of advanced machine learning with the end goal of improving our customer strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We recently sat down with one of ATB&rsquo;s data scientists dedicated to the partnership, </strong><a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/ualberta/\"><strong>Mark Sebestyen</strong></a>, who is on a mission to gamify banking and will explain how his team applies reinforcement learning to their data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why gamify banking?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason that reinforcement learning techniques work well for solving atari games, for example, is due to the strict rules of games - at any given moment in a certain state there are a finite number of options or actions with clear end targets or rewards and future scenarios to run through to select an optimal move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we can do is come up with a strategic algorithm for banking. The &lsquo;game&rsquo; we are trying to optimize is a multifunction optimization problem. Essentially, maximizing customer value while simultaneously maximizing value for ATB given a specific set of constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banking is complicated and complex. After all, we&rsquo;re looking at the financial wellness of individuals and their business. In order to take this complicated context and simplify it into a well-defined context, we start by identifying the three key variables of solving any reinforcement learning games: states, actions, and rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee661cd8366b89fdf8ebd/1543431783715/1.png?format=2500w\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The state</strong> is the financial context vector augmented with information relevant to financial decisions, banking needs and personal behavioural data. For example, a time-series of account balances on what banking products a customer has, how long they&rsquo;ve been banking with ATB and what specific interaction patterns they portray. Like in the game of Monopoly, each customer is a &lsquo;player&rsquo;. At any given time, they occupy a certain location on the board, have a certain amount of money, and have certain features. And at each moment there are a number of options that they have in working towards their goal of winning the game. That is where the action part comes into play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The action </strong>could be a customer action or an action taken by ATB. For example, offering a product, change of interest rates, or consultation on financial goals all the way down to the granularity of adjusting and personalizing the UI experience for that customer while they are logged into their online banking platform. Really our goal was to systematically go through all the actions we as ATB can digitally adjust for our customers and let our engine use those to come up with the best strategy for these clients. As an example, a feature product that can be powered by our engine is a digital banking platform that can continuously learn from and adopt to varying customer needs and will continue to learn more and more from ATB customers the more they use the platform. This is the most state of the art solution to deep personalization (this algorithm is literally straight out of the hot oven of RL research) and, to our knowledge, ATB could be the first bank that is using anything like this in application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The reward.</strong> Once an action has been taken in a certain state, the monopoly piece moves to a different position on the board. Here, we can evaluate whether financial value (e.g. investment portfolios as well as customer lifetime value, etc.) and other customer experience factors have increased, decreased, or remained the same. We do this through our own internal algorithms in combination with utilizing customer feedback and incorporation of survey results. As an example, after every google hangout session you get a mini-survey asking about the smoothness of the call. Similarly for us, these micro opinions can be easily incorporated into the platform and can provide huge value in custom tuning and deeply personalizing the UI/UX experience. For changes to our digital experience, a measure of reward may be the number of clicks it took to complete an action. For customer satisfaction and happiness, we may measure if they have moved further towards their indicated financial goals or look at how their engagement scores have changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"427x256\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc\" data-image-resolution=\"1000w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png?format=1000w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, <strong>problem constraints</strong> map out the boundary conditions - eg. everyone would be happy with a low or no interest MasterCard, but that is not something that we can necessarily offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that banking is not a game where you can boundlessly experiment with clients, which is why we are also committed to developing what we call in RL robust models. Thus, for example, our decision engine won&rsquo;t offer a MasterCard to a client already possessing that very product. In our models, this can be achieved by enforcing strict penalties for approaching bounds or violating game rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the K of N learner is a state of the art reinforcement learning technique for improving model robustness that we borrow from researchers on our team (Dr. Bowling and Dustin Morrill) as they employed similar techniques in solving the <a href=\"https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/michael-bowling\">game of Poker</a>.

Dr. Michael Bowling&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s algorithm is able to play a nearly perfect game of Heads-up Limit Texas Hold&#39;em. To quote Dr. Bowling, &ldquo;It is so close to perfect that even after an entire human lifetime of playing against it, you couldn&#39;t be statistically certain it wasn&#39;t perfect. We call such a game essentially solved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our &ldquo;game of banking&rdquo;, we sample N function distributions of the model at random from infinitely many choices while an antagonist fixes K of these distributions. The purpose is to train the protagonist to outplay the antagonist no matter how non-advantageous his fixed choices are. We need to still be able to choose the best solution regardless of what the adversarial fixed factors were. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"764x430\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional robustness is provided by testing our engines on certain data sets where states, actions, and rewards are very well defined, allowing us to closely monitor results and test robustness of our systems in the iteration process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are applying advanced machine learning models and computer systems to solve the problem of banking, we haven&rsquo;t lost touch with the humans behind it.

With Jackie&rsquo;s award winning work in designing service experiences across multiple industries including hospitality, health care, and business, and time spent working around the world, we knew she would help open up the possibilities and bring fresh perspectives to our in-branch experience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of our day-to-day activities shift online, from shopping, to catching up with friends, to changing details of our mortgage terms, so many experiences have gone from in-person to digital. This means that the role of bank branches and human-to-human customer service is continually evolving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we explore the value that we create through in-branch experiences, there are many lessons to learn from outside the banking industry.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the medical sector, there is a strong emphasis on &lsquo;helping&rsquo; and providing medical care. However, there is often a lack of &lsquo;service&rsquo; in the traditional sense. Think of the frustration of not knowing how long you&rsquo;ll be waiting in line or in a waiting room, not being welcomed with a friendly greeting, or having limited access to the information or services you need online. Not to mention the additional stress and anxiety of a sterile, crowded waiting room that adds to an already tense experience as you await medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrast this to entering a high-end hotel, where every part of the sensory experience is aimed at fostering a particular atmosphere and each staff member has the innate desire to serve and please guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a hotel, the arrival experience is critical. The sights and smells of a hotel lobby instill emotion&mdash;think of the cozy luxury of walking into the Fairmont Palliser in Calgary or the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton&mdash;or the energetic vibe of entering a W Hotel with vibrant colours and hip music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Of course, our goal is not to replicate a hotel experience within bank branches. The inspiration we have taken is about the human-centered approach to designing a space and providing optimized service through atmosphere and emotion that resonates with customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In designing our branches, we are purposeful in understanding the emotional state of customers when they enter, what they are looking to achieve, and how we can utilize space and technology to optimize how we deliver value and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One difference in banking is that the experience starts before a customer actually walks through the door. Entering a branch might be the third step in the customer&rsquo;s journey, as they &nbsp;may have already tried to process a transaction at an ATM or find the information online. When they enter a branch, they are looking to be assured that their problem will be solved, that they will be treated like a valued customer, and that their time will be well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we elevate the arrival experience in a branch? The first step we are taking is a co-creation process with our customers and branch team members to discover more about the emotional state and desires of customers when they enter. This will help us to design spaces and provide insights into how our customer service representatives can solve problems and alleviate stress for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the service side, language is a very important tool in the atmosphere created by staff.&nbsp;<em>Help&nbsp;</em>vs&nbsp;<em>Serve</em>.&nbsp;<em>Patient</em>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<em>Guest</em>. A shift in language (think financial caregiver) can provide a framework that impacts each interaction that takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our branches are an extension of our brand. They provide the opportunity for us to listen carefully to the needs of our customers and use the in-branch experience to learn more, build personal connections, and help Albertans on their financial journey.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In transforming ATB in-branch experiences, we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from everywhere, but our end goal is simple: for customers to leave feeling like they are one step closer to their financial goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining Jackie Mcatee and her team as they work to reimagine the branch experience?

But at ATB that&rsquo;s exactly what we strive to be. Being a large organization in an industry that is heavily regulated and risk-averse, it can be easy to stick to the same way of doing things because it&#39;s always been that way. However, we have always believed in finding the best and most value-driven solutions that serve Albertans &ndash; and that means being agile and forward thinking. One way we do this is by encouraging teams to leverage technology to create value-driven products quickly. We call these quick time to value projects and these projects are &nbsp;proven successful. The beauty of quick time to value projects is success comes almost immediately, as opposed to longer-term projects that take many years to provide all their value at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to deliver value to our customers, we need to deploy the right technology and tools for our teams. How can we make their days more efficient so that their time can be focused on what matters most: the people we serve? Enter ATB&#39;s Enterprise Data Science (EDS) team. They&#39;ve been working on clever ways to leverage existing technology to drive value within our organization by being dedicated to using data science techniques to solve everyday banking problems and ramp up efficiencies across multiple business units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the EDS-built tools now in use at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>The EDGuR1 chatbot</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Digging for information in a database, updating a timesheet, trying to remember the right acronym ... There are so many small, seemingly simple tasks and transactions that we (and all workers) do each day that add up and take away from our time that could be better spent on value added tasks. Built using the tools available within Google Cloud Platform, the EDS team created a fully functioning chatbot named EDGuR1 that provides team members fast access to hard to find, but easy to describe resources. The time savings EDGuR1 provides our team members, at a few minutes each day can amount to many people-hours saved &nbsp;on mundane task and instead on tasks that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Within two weeks EDS was able to build, deploy, and scale the chatbot at a very low cost and with minimal effort. Happier team members. Happier customers. Such a simple deployment of technology using existing tools and APIs had small, but transformational effects on the daily routines of ATB team members and is one of our favorite examples of quick, high value projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Optical Character Recognition</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a financial institution with significant business clientele, we regularly receive large amounts of financial information from clients, especially on business loans that are margined. In the past, this task required 12 full-time team members to go through each statement and manually enter information to calculate future loan values. It&rsquo;s a big task to say the least, and it takes away from our team members&rsquo; time &ndash; which is better spent on building client relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the past margined loans have been managed efficiently, and possible solutions of increasing efficiency are expensive and time consuming, often requiring third-party expertise. Instead our EDS and internal <em>Operation Automate</em> team collaborated over a short time period to develop a cloud-based automation tool leveraging Optical Character Recognition. This tool reads the text from incoming financial statements for margined loan accounts, and automatically extracts the right information and calculates the new margined loan amount, providing the customer with near-real-time access to their updated loan amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about how EDS built and deployed these solutions, we&rsquo;ll post an in-depth piece on this next time.

In our drive to lead the technology revolution of the banking sector, we&rsquo;ve been sharing our passion for areas like blockchain, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;<strong>This focus allows us to leverage a willingness to provide business banking solutions that go beyond traditional offerings.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a business banking client comes to ATB and says &lsquo;Sooooo, we&rsquo;re doing something a little different&hellip;,&rdquo; here at ATB, our ears perk up and we say &lsquo;how can we help?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s in our interest to make Alberta businesses across all sectors of the economy as competitive as possible and to make Alberta a place known for our openness to innovation: a great place to start and grow technology businesses.&nbsp;<strong>That is what we are setting out to do by working with businesses to create banking solutions that fit how business is done now and how it will be done in the future.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the oil and gas sector facing tighter margins, and the renewables sector exploding, the energy sector in particular is starving for innovative solutions and increased efficiency. We shared with you a while back our excitement about a blockchain proof of concept we have been working on for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/transactions-so-slick-you-might-slip\" target=\"_blank\">settling transactions for contracts in the oil and gas sector</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/49/\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re also supporting the great work of companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guild1.co/2018/02/14/guildones-royalty-ledger-settles-first-royalty-contract-on-r3s-corda-blockchain-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">GuildOne</a>; their innovative solution is streamlining fulfillment of smart contracts for oil royalty payments. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with royalty settlements in this space, think of an analogy of the music industry. When a song plays on the radio, there are a number of parties that may receive royalties at different rates: the artist, the song writer, a producer, etc...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contract and rates have been agreed to in advance, but when it actually comes down to payment, there may be different electronic copies of the contract flying around. Each party may perform the calculation themselves and then when payment comes through, if there are any discrepancies, it can result in huge delays and the need for many man hours of calculations, reissuance of payment, and a lot of time wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart contracts living on the blockchain can eliminate much of the waste and discrepancy by cementing the contract terms into a distributed ledger.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of oil royalty payments, contract negotiations are done separately and then cemented on the blockchain. Since ATB can read only the payment details of the smart contract directly from the blockchain, when a transaction is confirmed an Electronic Funds Transfer comes through and ATB initiates the fund transfer between parties. The smart contract in place truly is &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, we only see what we need to, which is the payment details. All other terms are kept confidential amongst the negotiating parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like a simple process, because it is.&nbsp;<strong>ATB&rsquo;s important role is our willingness to think outside of traditional banking.&nbsp;</strong>What we&rsquo;ve brought to the table is the option to initiate money movement based off payment instructions from a blockchain, rather than someone listed with signing authority on an account. Without this ability, fund transfer would have to be initiated manually by the payer, eliminating much of the benefit of the smart contract and the trust and reliability created by the blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no magic to it, but this is exactly what we&rsquo;ve been training for.&nbsp;<strong>We don&rsquo;t simply provide financial solutions based on traditional banking principles, we help businesses find solutions that fit the specific problems they are trying to solve and we bring our experiences with exponential technologies to the table.&nbsp;</strong>Are you looking to be part of the change that makes banking work for our Alberta businesses?

Our willingness to provide innovative business banking solutions is not limited to blockchain, as we continue to explore areas on the leading edge of technology, we&rsquo;re positioned to help Alberta businesses with the banking solutions of tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doing something a little different in business?

Although many assume these are on the distant horizon, we often forget that these are tools being put into MVP, pilot and practice across industries today. At ATB, one of our explorations into the combination of AI, Blockchain and automation is our application EVA, that has been deployed for more than 6 months across the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA (Easy Voice Autonomation) is one of the most nimble and effective projects related to AI, blockchain, and automation, and has the ability to exponentially transform banking. EVA is currently being leveraged within ATB to help us with our commitment to listen to our customers. Based on this commitment, we are focusing on improving the customer transactions experience &nbsp;that has resulted in negative feedback due to mistakes being made or the time taken to complete the task. We&rsquo;re also taking an &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; approach with EVA, by experimenting with EVA internally and gaining feedback from our team members prior to making it directly available to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blockchain we are using records processes, but not customer data. These processes are recorded where everything is secure and encrypted, as well as restricted by access permissions. &nbsp;This technology was chosen to enable solutions that are open and scalable, while ensuring its not dependent on a singular platform that could prevent us from expanding in the future. We chose to take on the challenges of blockchain to be at the forefront of this technology, exploring how we can use it to do what we do best: serve our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A current use case for EVA is the ability to save team members time and repetitive work when it comes to something as simple as changing an address. &nbsp;Connecting to the Canada Post API ensures the proper format of the address, saving ATB time and money on address remediation that many companies face in their customer records. Team members are able to enter address updates in one place and have that disseminated by the software robots who are fulfilling the request to each individual book of record where the information is required. &nbsp;Be it a customer profile, Mastercard or Investment account, customers can rest assured that all their accounts are updated accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the future, the goal is for EVA to anticipate our customers needs and take the onus off the customer for things such as address updates. Observables will allow for people to choose who can see and share their information and allow companies to pre-emptively update requirements when customer share. Imagine not having to call every company with whom you interact to update your address when you move, just simply allow these companies to listen for the updates you choose to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of EVA within ATB is to be able to rapidly create solutions that can transform the way we work and ultimately provide better customer service. It is because of this that we&rsquo;ve also&nbsp;chosen to incorporate natural language processing to better capture, translate, and figure out what the user is trying to accomplish when working with a given solution. The aim is to simplify every day tasks and make us more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EVA has been embraced by our robotics processing team and they are using EVA to build solutions for team members. As these solutions have been rolled out throughout the organization, it has allowed us to determine what features people inherently use, and which features need prompting, encouragement and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA allows branches and departments to solution for themselves, as opposed to being dependent on traditional IT departments or software development teams. This &ldquo;self serve&rdquo; ability saves time, money and manpower. EVA enables everyone to be part of the solution. &nbsp;We currently have 24 processes deployed internally to our team members that are fulfilled on the backend by our software robots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of EVA could be in a myriad of directions, as what we&rsquo;ve built is malleable and scalable which allows for future pivots and iterations. We could look at different use case applications within ATB, or even give back to the open source community by sharing knowledge with (and learning from), the incredible developer talent in our own backyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are committed to transformation at ATB and our stories are not done yet.

For any high performance team, it&rsquo;s THE F-word. So what does it <em>really</em> mean to celebrate failure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The dictionary may define failure as &lsquo;a lack of success,&rsquo; but for us, the definition just doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. Here is how we define failure in a way that allows us to celebrate and learn from it at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Recognizing when you&rsquo;ve taken the wrong path in reaching a particular goal and either switching paths or becoming stronger from taking the long way. Just because you are on the wrong path doesn&rsquo;t mean that you won&rsquo;t eventually get to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&lsquo;Failure&rsquo; is a temporal state on the path to a solution&mdash;like a baby learning to walk, an individual fall does not mean that success is not the ultimate outcome. In embracing and learning from mistakes and failures, we are ensuring our eventual success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We learn by doing, instead of watching. Being the first to attempt something new is a great way to increase your chances of failure, but we are brave enough to try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move through our transformation and adopt an agile mindset across the organization, it is crucial for our leadership and team members across ATB to have a common understanding of what failure is and why we celebrate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The micro failures, the day-to-day choices and decisions that come with the agile mindset are opportunities to be humble, correct our path, and learn quickly from our mistakes. This pivot in thinking is part of how we can shift from incremental change to 10X leaps. Being able to change paths, or adjust the target entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got the tools to help team members think and talk about failure in a way that helps move us forward. Things like a failure toolkit with survey insights, our definition of failure and the reasoning behind this shift in mentality. We engage, leveraging internal platforms such as transformation talks and G+ communities where we socialize and reflect on individual and team failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to think of it, you might say that we have already &lsquo;failed&rsquo; at celebrating failure. With our most recent surveys showing only 50% of the organization aligned with our definition successfully celebrating failure. We may not be at our target yet, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we won&rsquo;t get there. Whether we are developing new banking tools, or working to change our company culture, we take the learnings and celebrate failures, because we have faith it will make our solutions even stronger.

With over 15 years of history working together, this year, SAS presented ATB with the Insight Award to recognize the innovation behind the deployment of SAS Viya on the Google Cloud platform. It was the first ever Google Cloud deployment in North America and the first large-scale full production deployment of the SAS Viya software in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data analysis is core to our mission to provide better banking services and improve the lives of Albertans. From risk analysis and fraud detection to mobile app customization and customer service improvements, high powered data analytics can unlock huge returns in how we serve our customers. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re committed to equipping our teams with the tools to leverage machine learning, robotics process automation, computer vision, and natural language processing. Rather than having distinct groups of experts in charge of applied technology, we want team members across the organization to ideate and prototype solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of the key strategies to put the power of advanced technology in the hands of more ATB team members is founded on cloud deployments and powered by solutions like SAS. The Viya software, in particular, provides friendly user-interfaces in multiple programming languages and integrations with other technologies like Google Tensorflow.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our technology teams shift from developing tools to providing services, we need a platform that gives us access to open source and proprietary algorithms in machine learning. The Google Cloud deployment of SAS Viya allows us to do just that and empowers team members to use cutting-edge techniques to solve problems with advanced model management&mdash;reviewing and validating models before deploying in products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a multistakeholder partnerships between ATB, SAS, Google, and Hortonworks, we successfully made the inaugural deployment of SAS Viya on the cloud.&nbsp;<strong>With the platform in place and with wide access across ATB business teams, now team members can focus on what they are good at: applying AI and ML to solve problems and make banking better for Albertans.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful deployment is a reward in itself, but we&rsquo;re proud of the collaborative effort and happy to celebrate the project as we build on it for even greater successes in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in being part of the ATB team working on innovative and collaborative projects?<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">&nbsp;Check out our live job postings.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"21.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/016/v_768_ATB-AlphaBeta-InnovationAward-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/016/v_500_ATB-AlphaBeta-InnovationAward-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb","tags":[{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"},{"id":13,"title":"Partnerships"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":16,"title":"Data"}],"labs":[]},{"id":15,"title":"Customer onboarding in the era of apps: All aboard the Onboarding Express","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 22:50","facets":["progress","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":true,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Accepting status quo in customer experience at traditional financial institutions is no longer acceptable. There was a time when the only option for customers was which bank to go with. In the age of fintech startups, cryptocurrencies, challenger banks, and virtual finance, the experience of banking is no longer siloed in the eyes of consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers are comparing their banking experience to the magic of getting out of an Uber &lsquo;without paying&rsquo;; the ease with which you can rent out your house on AirBnB; or signing in to Slack with a &lsquo;magic link&rsquo; instead of a password you&rsquo;ll never remember.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are taking the challenge head-on, inspired by what we&rsquo;ve heard from ATB customers: how they want to interact with their bank and their expectations for in-person and virtual interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure that we are providing exceptional experiences for our customers, we had to change some things about how we operate. One of those changes was the launch of our digital platform. Overlaying our legacy structure and processes, the platform allows our teams to build processes based on the human experiences, instead of the corporate structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first prototype built on the ATB digital platform is Onboarding Express. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/progress/four-minute-account-opening-shifting-from-transaction-to-human-interaction\">launching early in 2018</a>&nbsp;in a single branch in Calgary, it has now been rolled out to all 175 ATB branches province-wide and has been used to open over 200 new retail bank accounts. Not to mentioned giving our team members the ability to wow our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onboarding Express leverages the digital platform by eliminating the need to fill out information on multiple forms, destined for different departments, and to have customers repeat the spelling of their names and their exact address multiple times as it is entered in different systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because we have automated connections between back-end portals and removed transcription errors with solutions like scanning driver&rsquo;s licences, our team was able to overcome the constraints based on business processes and focus on building an experience based on how we want customers to feel when they are opening an account with ATB.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re welcomed to a bike-share app, it can be as pleasant as scanning a QR code on your phone and hopping on your bike in less than a minute. With this in mind, we knew there was a better way to be welcomed into the ATB family.&nbsp;<strong>As we build life-long and multi-generational relationships with ATB customers, we really care about making a great first-impression to show customers that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll treat them for a lifetime.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Onboarding Express marking the inaugural success on the digital platform, our team has already begun working to improve other first-impression processes, like business banking and mortgage approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital banking platform connecting back end systems and opening up our ability to connect with APIs is what powers these types of solutions. Soon we&rsquo;ll be connecting our systems with external data like corporate registry information, digital document signing systems, and data storage platforms. Without the digital platform, it would have been nearly impossible to set up these sorts of integrations while maintaining a delightful customers experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we look at different ways to enhance the experience of banking, we&rsquo;re drawing inspiration not just from our own industry, but from the best apps, companies, and experiences out there. And most importantly, listening to Albertans about how they want to experience banking.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for a new bank account and you have five minutes to spare?

You probably braced yourself to wait in a line or a waiting area; and if it was in the recent past, you made sure your smartphone was charged so you could scroll the news feed while answering procedural questions coming from someone immersed in their computer screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead and Google &ldquo;How long does it take to open a bank account?&rdquo; The answer varies from 30 minutes, to two days, to ten days. We&rsquo;re out to change this. And we&rsquo;re doing it by shifting our sights from corporate requirements to user and customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of getting our account opening process to under 4 minutes began with ATB Transformation team members spending &lsquo;a day in the life&rsquo; of frontline staff. What better way to uncovered pain points? As the &lsquo;First Encounter&rsquo; for ATB customers, account opening seemed like a fitting pilot to test new systems and break down barriers to human centred service delivery. With this goal in mind,&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>he team set out to move from &ldquo;how do you spell that?&rdquo; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s dream together&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>and see if they could meet a challenge put forth by our Chief Transformation Officer,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Wellington_ATB\" target=\"_blank\">Wellington Holbrook</a>&nbsp;to open a brand new account (including debit card in hand and Online Banking set up) in four minutes or less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain why the seemingly simple task of setting up a new account can be so complex, we have to lift the curtain a bit behind the complex workings and regulatory requirements of a Canadian Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the siloed corporate areas of a bank operated independently. For example, the risk and compliance side of the business has certain requirements for account opening. Then add a layer on top of that for opening a debit account. And another to apply for a credit card.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the old model, each siloed team has a different tool, screen, or form, and different information requirements. What happens typically is frontline team members are left to manage different systems and processes that don&rsquo;t work together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution that the Transformation Team created is built on a&nbsp;<strong>versatile digital platform that will help us elevate and integrate processes, making it easy to deliver best in class experiences</strong>. It streamlines the process for ATB frontline team members and&nbsp;<strong>overwhelmingly improves the account opening experience for ATB customers.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially what the new process looks like for customers and ATB team members is an easy scan of a driver&rsquo;s license, a few on-screen questions to answer, and then in the back-end, the system transforms the information into the right formats and makes service calls to underlying systems in our separate corporate areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The old process was built around the bank&rsquo;s and the regulator&rsquo;s requirements, with the customer experience coming second. The new one is built for user and customer experience first.&nbsp;</strong>It converts the &lsquo;transactional experience&rsquo; of the past to a more human interaction. For ATB, this means we&rsquo;re saving time and streamlining processes. But for our frontline staff, it means they can be dreaming with customers, not typing and re-typing information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A rapid account opening process means team members can spend more time learning about their customer&rsquo;s dreams and goals, and setting them on a path to happiness. Or it means we can help customers get in and out quickly, confident that they have the banking products that they need.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we&rsquo;re not just solving one problem at a time. The key to the solution is enterprise architecture, a new platform that sits on top of the underlying corporate structure and processes here at ATB. Our internal teams building off of the enterprise layer are now able to focus on building the best experience, rather than worrying out integrating processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re changing banking by focussing on the experience we want customers to have, and then applying technology to make that a reality. We&rsquo;re piloting this rapid process now, and already looking to apply the principal to improve experiences from mortgage lending to business banking.&nbsp;<strong>We want to find more ways to spend less time on the transaction, and more time on the human interaction.&nbsp;Are you interested in being part of meaningful projects just like this?

For example: increasing total deposits, creating cross-selling opportunities, acquiring new customer segments, or providing liquidity. The downside of challenger brands founded on the business need of a parent company is that they often come with a lack of inherent user-focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, independent challenger banks face a number of other obstacles - they may have a completely different operating model, and potentially lack a banking licence (which means that customers don&rsquo;t benefit from deposit insurance). Alternative models are often built specifically for a customer need and can involve pre-paid cards, creative product structuring, personal financial management tools, or great mobile applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A potential downside faced by independent challenger banks, particularly in North American markets, is a lack of trust, which can be an enormous barrier to customer acquisition in the banking sector. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, as we explore our own challenger brand, we are learning from both the institutional sub-brand model and the startup approach, looking to leverage the upside of each while avoiding mistakes and pitfalls. How do we build banking for the growing segment of the population who are &lsquo;digital natives,&rsquo; no matter their age, without being weighed down by assumptions about what &lsquo;banking&rsquo; is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than starting from scratch, we&rsquo;re coming in with the the power, experience, and resources of an established institution.

We are striving to identify customer problems and to respond to opportunities the moment a customer need arises. To achieve this, one of the research streams at the ATB AI Lab is geared towards building a real-time Artificial Intelligence system. With vast amounts of data, we need to distinguish signals from an ocean of noise, so we are using big data techniques to process incoming data streams and we&rsquo;re applying machine learning algorithms to extract informative behavioral signals. Make sure to subscribe to alphaBeta to get more details about &nbsp;the complex problems that our research teams are tackling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our partnership with UAlberta, we are able to invest resources into a flexible platform &nbsp;instead of a single-purpose solution, that enables collaboration and will help us build for tomorrow. Decentralization and modularity are core to this model, so we&rsquo;re creating an &ldquo;extensible platform&rdquo;: blended with architecture, language, and interfaces that will enable different components created by a team of researchers &nbsp;to co-exist and interact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re building an early prototype in a cloud-based infrastructure, focused on data storage, processing capability, machine learning algorithms, and APIs. Our microservices-oriented solution connects all the components of the system together, joining messaging buses, with mathematical models and databases to query data for real-time event detection. New components can be easily created and integrated into the overall system. The setup is like a &lsquo;social-network&rsquo; for different components, allowing them to interact, and accommodate each other without significant dependence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why does industry-academia partnership benefit from a microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with academic institutions provides a unique experience, in part because academic research tends to be horizontal in nature, with researchers working independently on different components of the system architecture. For the ATB AI Lab, building a microservices setup that is flexible, portable, and adaptable means that we can quickly change our tech stack when new challenges arise, without building an entirely new solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than working separately and trying to integrate technical pieces at an mature project stage, we can add and remove components, include different databases, data transformation pipelines, and predictive modeling modules to react quickly to make sure we are at the forefront in solving problems for our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why start with a prototype of the microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research partners are experts in their fields, but in some cases are not entirely familiar with banking. Launching a prototype phase gives teams a playground to get used to the types of data that we have and the types of problems we are solving in banking. It also provides us an opportunity to test the onboarding of new research teams and academic &nbsp;partners&mdash;a sort of training phase before the wheels come off for both us and our research partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to giving the researchers a sandbox, our in-house data science teams were able to see the immediate value of this prototype and are quickly deploying successful &nbsp;solutions based on proofs-of-concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we deepen our research partnership with UAlberta, we are excited to be building more than a single purpose technical solution - our aim is to have a system where components built by researchers, students, and ATB data scientists can interact seamlessly. With this system, we are translating the power of machine learning algorithms to applied banking solutions, to make banking better.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"24.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time","tags":[{"id":4,"title":"AI"},{"id":8,"title":"Machine Learning"}],"labs":[]},{"id":14,"title":"Challenger banks and embracing irrationality in banking","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/014/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 21:46","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Challenger banks (also known as neobanks or sometimes online-only banks) are pushing the traditional banking sector with novel solutions, user centric products, and impressive traction with customer acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them, challenger banks are independent companies or nimble brands under the umbrella of established financial institutions. They can be skunkworks operations targeting a new business model, customer segment, cost structure, brand, or strategy. They vary from startup companies providing a full range of banking services, to smaller, specialized brands with one or two specific offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard rumblings that ATB is launching a challenger bank. Well it is certainly true that we&rsquo;re always looking to challenge ourselves&mdash;and what better way to do that than to take a team of exceptional team members and set out to develop a standalone banking solution that creates better experiences for people in life, not just in banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;re focussed on challenging is the fundamental perspective that banks are meant to help people be responsible and rational with their money. Because banking is something that is done to you, not for you. We don&rsquo;t want to change people, we want to support who they are by providing banking services that are delightful, simple to use, and improve the experience of daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banking is a very rational dimension of life. However, what people feel about their money and finances exists on a separate plane, one that is driven more by emotion than rationality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we started looking at how we could challenge ourselves and the banking sector, we started out not just by looking at what other challenger banks are doing around the world, but we also took the time to stop and listen to what Albertans want. With over 600 one-on-one interviews and dozens of focus groups to-date, we&rsquo;ve uncovered valuable gems about what people want from banking products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we uncovered is that banking products are not necessarily broken. We don&rsquo;t have to entirely change how chequing accounts and credit cards work. We uncovered that people want digital offerings that help them do what they are already doing outside of banking. For example, vault accounts where people implement their own controls on how and when they can access their money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re serious about finding out how to make banking feel good, which is why we&rsquo;ve partnered with researchers from the University of Calgary to validate customer feedback on banking and user interfaces that create happiness and reduce stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of challenger banks is that they are not weighed down by legacy systems. In many cases, the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind processes and requirements in banking is like the pea at the bottom of a pile of mattresses. We&rsquo;re committed to peeling back to the fundamentals, breaking paradigms, and stepping out of the traditional perspective to embrace irrationality and the human aspects of finance and banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We want to open as many channels as possible for customers, so they can drive the experience, rather than saying &lsquo;here is the right thing to do with your money.&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put the power in the hands of our customers, we are building a flexible operating system based in the cloud and partnering with incredible companies like <a href=\"https://www.technisys.com/\">Technisys</a> out of Argentina and other top fintechs through API interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Albertans, at ATB we&rsquo;re not the type to sit back while the world changes around us. We&rsquo;re taking this challenge head on, getting our hands dirty to challenge ourselves, and banking. Can&rsquo;t wait to hear more?

But in reality, to run a business, hire staff, buy servers/equipment, rent an office, and pay utilities and taxes, every business needs at least some fiat currency. This means that <strong>cryptocurrency ventures in most cases still need to rely on business banking services from more traditional banking services providers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it can be challenging for cryptocurrency-focused ventures to find business banking services through traditional banks. This is particularly the case for up-and-coming Canadian crypto exchanges looking for business banking services here at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not without good reason that, historically, cryptocurrency has been taboo for banks. <strong>The anonymity and barriers to satisfying regulatory requirements that are the foundation of many currencies and exchanges often make traditional business banking off limits. </strong>Banks are built upon the tenets of knowing customers, avoiding money laundering, and minimizing financial and brand risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As blockchain technology becomes more integrated across sectors and cryptocurrencies take a growing place in the financial and business landscape, <strong>lack of knowledge, balancing needs of various customers, or fear may hinder more traditional financial institutions from taking part in this growing segment of the economy.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is not afraid of testing new waters, so we started the journey of exploring the risks and opportunities of cryptocurrency banking services. We started by carefully examining the different segments of the cryptocurrency space and identifying areas where ATB could feasibly work within regulatory compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we first explored the possibility of providing business banking services to firms operating in the cryptocurrency space, our traditional risk and compliance measures resulted in a big &lsquo;NO&rsquo;. This provided us with an exceptional opportunity to look again at our systems to see how we might be able to get to a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Working directly with our in-house experts, we made the big first step of identifying KYC (Know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money-laundering) thresholds that would have to be met in order for a business to qualify for business banking with ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crossing the threshold of banking with a cryptocurrency based business would be a big thing for a traditional institution like ATB.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a perfect fit for ATB to lead the way on business banking for eligible cryptocurrency businesses in Alberta. We see benefits for ATB, our clients, and for the overall economy. For our eighty-year history, we have been dedicated to transforming quickly to support Albertans as they build businesses in an ecosystem known for innovation, entrepreneurship, and calculated risk taking. ATB understands that different business sectors have different banking needs, they don&rsquo;t all fit in the same box. We&rsquo;ve done it before with <a href=\"http://www.atb.com/business/experts/arts-and-culture-branch/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">business banking for Arts and Culture</a> and now we&rsquo;re learning how we can support cryptocurrency business with banking services..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will be part of the future. Being a jurisdiction known for supporting businesses and fostering a developer community around new technologies has great potential to positively impact the entire business community in Alberta.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got our foot in the door, we&rsquo;re looking to the future for how we can overcome barriers to provide the next generation of business and consumer banking products and services that Albertans need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in bridging the gap between cryptocurrency businesses and banking services?

The traditional approach for technology infrastructure and applications is: reuse first, then buy, and if there is no product that fits, build.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ATB is dedicated to constantly innovating, iterating, and improving. This means having organizational infra</strong><strong>structure that sets us apart with speed and agility, helping us bring smart ideas to life quickly.</strong>&nbsp;In 2017, we took a hard look at our processes and infrastructure, including our &lsquo;reuse, buy, build&rsquo; hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our investigation, we were reminded that buying a product can have some serious pitfalls. Though often commended for being the cheaper and quicker option, going with an off-the-shelf software has risks of incompatibility and limits in functionality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customizations can also lead to nightmares when new versions are released. We dare you to find an IT manager who doesn&rsquo;t have a story to tell about getting so deep into customizations that a simple update can mean a system (and mental) meltdown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ve flipped the model on its head, moving &lsquo;build&rsquo; above &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. The build-first model requires an up-front investment that can prove challenging for many organizations. It also means that tools can take a little bit longer to get into the hands of team members, but the time and human resources investment can pay off big.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So why go the custom-built software route? It comes down to customization and growth.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key to success with the new hierarchy is a team equipped with the skills and technology stack to feasibly build solutions. At ATB we&rsquo;ve got the talent pool and the same technology stack as the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first foray was to build the ATB Digital Platform that powers our rapid account opening process. The platform is the &lsquo;plumbing&rsquo; of a scalable system that overlays ATB&rsquo;s legacy infrastructure, creating a custom platform that is easier to scale to other systems and processes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we had the plumbing in place, we brought a group of ATB developers into the lab and trained them up on the tools that underlay the Digital Platform. Now we have a team of developers who are able to quickly scale custom solutions to problems faced by our internal teams and ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building the software ourselves means features are fully customized and not at the mercy of version updates.&nbsp;</strong>We are able to adapt the ATB Digital Platform quickly in response to changing needs. Building from scratch allows for the programs to grow with us, and the investment is scalable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buying a product might work for what we need right now, but what about five years down the road? A forward-thinking mindset eliminates future frustrations of working with lagging technology or, worse, being bogged down by updating and testing customizations or being forced to transfer everything over to a new system in a few years time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transformation Team at ATB has catalyzed many positive iterations in how we do our work. Our organization structure is now structured for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">customer experience-based design;</a> our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">teams are inclusive</a>; the way we design is built for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way/\">speed and agility</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way\">.</a> In the name of innovation, we&rsquo;re not afraid to veto stale paradigms and provide meaningful solutions to problems large and small.

Normally renaming an internal department is not a newsworthy event, but as our traditional IT department became anything <strong>but</strong> traditional, the transitioned from &ldquo;IT Service Delivery&rdquo; to &ldquo;Technology Enablement&rdquo; reflected more than just a name change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change reflects a different approach to providing foundational IT systems and support. Our Technology Enablement team is the &lsquo;engine room,&rsquo; keeping the lights on and the systems powered so that team members can &nbsp;make enormous leaps like implementing <a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/reuse-buy-or-build-new-answers-to-old-questions-in-software-and-tech\">robotics process optimization</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/11\">,</a> <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">cloud deployments of the most advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">,</a> and <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/19\">microservices architecture for more flexible collaborative work environments</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are making huge changes as the entire organization moves towards agile methodology and the cloud, the tools and principles that we apply in Technology Enablement vary slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in Agile methodology, a Scrum team is very disciplined with a very focused goal. The &lsquo;fires&rsquo; that can arise in traditional IT can cause a huge distraction to a Scrum team. That&rsquo;s why we are taking care of all those fires so that IT teams in other departments can run disciplined Scrums without worrying about the underlying systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So rather than implementing full Scrum methodology, we use the agile mindset and apply the principles across our enterprise systems. We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of carving off dedicated team members, or ignoring fires, but we do have the principles of agile development that we can apply in a more traditional IT environment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key principles we have adopted is the automation of repetitive testing and regular checks of our core systems, freeing up team resources that used to be dedicated to continual testing of core systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discrete workflows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another principle we have adopted from agile development is breaking work into discrete pieces rather than massive upgrades or changes. Compartmentalizing changes allows us to allocate resources more effectively, knowing the &lsquo;steps&rsquo; means that we can pull team members off projects without disrupting entire processes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ceremonies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many agile methodologies have very specific ceremonies, like sprint planning meetings, retrospectives and standups. Many of these ceremonies are extremely effective for project communication, prioritization, and optimization workflow. Even without adopting the full agile methodology, many of the ceremonies of agile development prove effective for teams in traditional IT environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the big changes in our transformation at ATB has been moving to the cloud and to fully integrate systems. This transition is both a blessing and a curse for IT managers. Integration means things are connected, but the downside is that there can be dramatic ripple effects of changes especially as it relates to the taking advantage of the new techniques and features of cloud platforms. In the traditional IT space of running big, bulky systems, we have the added challenge of adopting the key principles of the agile mindset, while making sure that we are alleviating some of the curses of legacy large scale integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since traditional IT success is measured against availability, reliability, and security, we take a different mindset to agile development to compensate for the added downside risk of service interruption or failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we take pride in the fact that we are far ahead of many in the banking sector globally. Moving from mainframe systems years before many other large financial institutions. Our job in Technology Enablement is to make sure that the legacy and core systems are available, reliable, and secure, while providing ATB transformation team members advanced tools, technology, and power to live up to our mission of transforming the lives of Albertans through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is about making your time richer. Our customer obsession infiltrates the entire organization. Our front end staff want to make our customers time richer. Our transformation team wants our front end staff to have the tools to provide the best service to customers. And, whatever name they go by, our Tech Enablement team wants to ensure that Transformation team members can spend their time where it is most valuable, with stable and reliable technology behind them.

In one sprint we can dedicate resources to optimizing the user experience, while the next is dedicated to implementing new product features. From simple bug fixes to launching digital products through new distribution channels, product managers must constantly weigh business and user needs to allocate resources towards the optimal vectors of improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks in part to this optimized development process, user interfaces have experienced massive evolution (think of the transition from typing commands, to mouse clicks, to touch screens), conversational user interfaces (UI) like virtual chatbots and voice assistants are beginning to rise up as the technology of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve previously shared details from the product team behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ATBFinancial/\">ATB&rsquo;s virtual assistant&nbsp;</a>in Facebook Messenger, including their<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/product-development-in-the-era-of-decay-of-delight\">&nbsp;fondness for &lsquo;decay of delight&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;that drives product improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re giving a sneak peak at how they are taking their passion, learnings, and experimentation to be ahead of the curve with natural language processing and the user interfaces of the future. Check out some of the vectors of improvement where the team is creating business and customer value with conversational UI, starting with the ATB virtual assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 1 - UX improvements: mapping natural language to intent</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is one thing to train humans to input commands that a computer understands. It is a completely other process to teach a computer to map natural human language inputs to intent.&nbsp;</strong>That is the first layer for our approach to conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving the user experience provides customers the solution to their problems with as little friction as possible. Improving confidence levels and increasing the scope of utterances is the key way to reduce friction for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From learning all the different ways that someone may ask for their account balance, to increasing the number of tasks that can be performed autonomously, every challenging question that a customer asks is an opportunity for us to learn and improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try asking any voice assistant or chatbot what the exchange rate is right now, you&rsquo;ll likely get a response, but it might not be the exact form you were looking for. From early users, we took this learning and improved the way the ATB virtual assistant responds. Now you&rsquo;ll get options for CAD to USD, USD to CAD, or links to other exchange rates. Making sure that users get the answers they are looking for, not frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 2 - Integrations for task completion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Following mapping an utterance to intent, the next layer in conversational UI is to perform an action based on the identified intent.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, it is crucial to integrate back end systems so that tasks can be performed autonomously. If Alexa is not paired to your phone, you won&rsquo;t get the song you requested. If Siri can&rsquo;t activate your messenger app, it will be hard to use voice to text your mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got strong collaboration between our internal data teams to provide the needed back end integration. That has also allowed us to provide features like push notifications with proactive and personalized notifications to customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Can you imagine if your cell phone provider proactively called you to tell you that there was a plan that would meet all of your needs and save you money? Probably doesn&rsquo;t happen now for most of us...what if ATB could do that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now testing a feature in the ATB virtual assistant that will track customers&rsquo; recent account fees and transactions, and will notify them if they could have saved money on fees using a different type of account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With conversational UI optimized for natural language processing and tied into back-end systems, the future is bright for creating frictionless banking experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 3 - Optichannel experiences to support conversational UI adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before on alphaBeta about our commitment to providing exceptional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/37\">optichannel</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optichannel-not-omnichannel\">&nbsp;</a>experiences, where customers can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As users become more accustomed to the capabilities and limitations of voice and text interactions, optichannel remains a crucially important vector of improvement for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are striving for seamless optichannel experiences through a feature that allows customers to move from the AI based chat to a customer care agent within Facebook Messenger. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we work on expanding the tasks that can be autonomously completed, there are still instances where customers need to connect with an ATB team member. So if someone is chatting and they are faced with a problem that the bot can&rsquo;t complete - the bot can now connect them directly to a customer care agent who can authenticate the customer within the chat and provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recognize that dedicating development resources to maintain optichannel integrations will remain an important factor in adoption rate of conversational UI and we are optimizing our development time accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 4 - New channel implementation: the magic of channel-agnostic conversational UI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversational UI is fairly channel-agnostic. You&rsquo;ll talk the same way with a voice assistance through your smart-watch, phone, or desktop computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ATB virtual assistant, that means that the learnings we draw from our integration with Facebook Messenger can be easily rolled out across other channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the chief benefits of the ATB virtual assistant when we launched was having Facebook Messenger as the channel. ATB customers were able to connect with their bank in the same channel where they connect with family and friends. Our aim was to help people integrate positive financial habit building into a channel that they were already using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That channel was just a start for our conversational UI. Internally, we are working with a virtual-assistant-as-a-service model to deploy the user experience into different ATB properties. We have the capabilities to integrate the bot into channels such as the ATB website or our own mobile application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our development resources are dedicated to the vectors of improvement that will provide value to ATB customers. With the ATB virtual assistant, we&rsquo;re improving mappings of natural language to increase the scope of tasks that can be undertaken by the bot. We&rsquo;re making sure there is seamless optichannel integration and rolling out conversational UI into multiple channels to help integrate the banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much work to be done in fintech and across sectors in the capabilities and adoption of conversational UI, but we see its potential to greatly reduce friction in banking and an almost unlimited number of uses cases. We&rsquo;ll continue to work across vectors of improvement to create happiness through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining the Transformation team and working on reducing friction in banking through conversational UI?&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/#divisions\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open positions</a></strong>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"29.05.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"vectors-of-improvement-for-conversational-user-interfaces","tags":[],"labs":[]},{"id":9,"title":"‘Partnership’ is the new best practice in vendor relationship management","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/009/ATB-AlphaBeta-Client_Vendor-FINAL.gif","date":"23.10.2018 21:24","facets":["connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>The world is swimming with technology applications that are made to solve problems that large companies face. For organizations, the holy grail is often to crack into the &lsquo;corporate client&rsquo; market. Whether it is enterprise software with long sales cycles and fully customized deployment, or a bottom-up effort getting individual staff members to push for company adoption of tools such as Dropbox or Slack&mdash;the key to success for many organizations is getting corporate buy-in and adoption of paid service offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not all corporate clients are equally attractive for vendors, especially those working in emerging spaces or applying new technologies in more traditional sectors, like banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recently had great success working with SAS on the <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">world&rsquo;s first large-scale full production deployment</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\"> </a>of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud. Our eagerness to listen and learn doesn&rsquo;t stop with ATB customers, so we sat down with the project team to hear what made this project so successful and what makes a great client-vendor partnerships with the types of innovative technology companies that we&rsquo;re eager to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing we noticed when sitting down with the team was how tough it was to spot who works for ATB and who works for the vendor. From SAS, &ldquo;the greatest compliment we can get is to sit down with an executive team and have them think that we are in-house staff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we figured out who works where, we dug into the details to find out how the ATB + SAS Viya deployment team eschewed the vendor-client relationship to build a collaborative partnership. Here are a few of the things they shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Get organization-wide buy in. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is not enough for the direct client area to be great at collaborating with vendors. For institutions like ATB, deploying any type of new software or program requires buy-in and collaboration from many different business areas. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though there were some risks in undertaking an un-tried deployment of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud, the project had strong support, not only from executive and project teams, but also procurement, finance, and legal. This was crucial to successful launch and keeping the project on schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Nothing beats face-to-face. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, electronic communications are fast and efficient, but building personal relationships and getting key parties in one room for important brainstorming or decision making can make or break a project. For the SAS Viya deployment, project members from Google, Hortonworks, SAS, and ATB gathered in Edmonton for brainstorming and project planning at the outset. Throughout the project, morning standups via video conference made sure that all parties were in the loop, with open lines of communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of in-person workshops allowed the multi-party project to work through issues like risk identification, security requirements, and optimizing network performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Start with trust. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our partnerships with vendors are more like a marriage than a sales transaction. And just like in a successful marriage, both parties need to be committed to giving trust freely, and earning it continuously. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve learned the hard way not to give specifications to a vendor and to blindly trust that they will deliver. But those challenging relationships haven&rsquo;t stopped us from giving trust where it is deserved. Trust means not jumping to contract terms and fighting to be right, but working through problems to find a common solution. Trust means being upfront about intentions and providing clear and continuous feedback about what is going well and what is not. Trust sometimes means forgiving mistakes and working to improve together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t just sell, solve. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because a tech startup got face time with a corporate client, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is a good fit. Both parties can suffer when there is misalignment between the client needs (or what they think they need) and what the vendor intends to design, or what they think the market needs. For a tech startup, landing a huge corporate client and then finding out that what they want requires a custom-build, or differs from where the product was headed, can derail future growth potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly on the client side, putting time and money into a technology solution that doesn&rsquo;t fit the exact use-case can be a setback at best, or detrimental at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With SAS, we dug into the use-case very deeply and found fundamental alignment to explore the new area of deploying SAS Viya entirely in the cloud. Together, we architected the solution, working on every piece of hardware being installed, the specs, the software, and configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the first step was making sure that we had alignment between the client-problem and the vendor solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ask the right questions. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we are working with a new vendor, there are some very telling questions that indicate whether it is going to be a great partnership. Here are just a few of the questions we love to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can you tell me about a time you <em>successfully</em> worked with a vendor my size?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can we send a staff member to work out of your office?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can I call you unannounced?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>How can I help you succeed? What other solutions have you tried?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we strive to be the type of client that vendors dream of partnering with. Our teams are made up of passionate people, working on exciting projects to leverage data and change our business operations with the ultimate goal of making our customers happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not just picking a product to buy, we&rsquo;re choosing life-long partners and aligning ourselves with people. Both the client and vendor are better off working in partnership; the <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">evidence is clear</a> that we can achieve more in architecting solutions together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like our partnership with our customers to help them create happiness in their lives, we look to partner with vendors who understand why we care and share our passion, determination, and commitment to creating value. Interested in a technology partnership with ATB? We&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"02.10.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/009/v_768_ATB-AlphaBeta-Client_Vendor-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/009/v_500_ATB-AlphaBeta-Client_Vendor-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"partnership-is-the-new-best-practice-in-vendor-relationship-management","tags":[{"id":13,"title":"Partnerships"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":13,"title":"Maximizing impact from ‘minimum viable’ roll-out—how soon is ‘too soon’?","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/013/ATB-AlphaBeta-MVP-FINAL.gif","date":"23.10.2018 21:30","facets":["connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Product development in agile environments often means rolling out products before they&rsquo;re ready. It is a tightrope to walk in terms of timing and product readiness to ensure a successful MVP rollout and long term adoption of a successful product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, we ran our <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/customer-onboarding-in-the-era-of-apps-all-aboard-the-onboarding-express\">first prototype of an internal tool built on our digital platform.</a> But when we launched the MVP version of of Onboarding Express, it was far from completely perfect (as any MVP normally is). Here are a few of reasons why we are working with a &lsquo;roll-out-now&rsquo; mentality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Value &gt; Perfection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If there is an iota of immediate value created by the MVP version of the product, there is an opportunity cost to holding it back to a later stage&mdash;why wait when you could be creating value, solving a problem, or selling a product now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When our product team spent &lsquo;a-day-in-the-life&rsquo; with ATB team members in branches. We saw the urgent need to change the account opening process. Between the burden on staff of holding up a conversation while navigating multiple interfaces and the missed opportunity to add value with a brand new ATB customer, this was an urgent problem that needed to be solved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">With our new digital platform, it was the perfect time to prototype. Luckily, our in-branch partners saw the potential and were eager to test an MVP even through the initial bumps. For Onboarding express, the early roll-out validated that we were moving in the right direction and allowed us to collect feedback and make functionality fixes that meant better interactions and more smiles on the faces of both ATB staff and our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If it can start making team members and customers lives better today, we should put it in the hands of team members now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Phase-two never comes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Have you ever worked on a service or product roll out that had an elaborate plan for &lsquo;phase-two,&rsquo; but that second phase never came? That is one of the risks of rolling out a product that is nearly ready. If functionality is far enough along and value is being delivered, it is too easy to pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next big challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Rolling out while things are still clunky or broken means you have to keep working on it. Baby steps take much less momentum than jumping across a gaping crevasse, so it&rsquo;s easier to keep a project moving continually forward, with less risk that we might fall in or get distracted before taking off. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The early roll out not only pushed us to quickly improve functionality, but it also enabled us to incorporate important learnings that we might otherwise have missed. Things like loosening the character limits on the user names and increasing the time window to activate a debit card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We&rsquo;re still working on improving Onboarding Express, but somehow the crevasse is behind us and we&rsquo;re still moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>It builds a culture of adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Across the ATB Transformation team and the entire organization, we&rsquo;re building a <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/fostering-a-culture-of-adoption\">culture of adoption</a>. That means team members are eager and willing to take up new tools and technology. They&rsquo;re willing to join in the building process because they share the belief that we&rsquo;re making positive changes that will create value for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Just like any muscle, we need to be constantly exercising our adoption abilities, building our strength. One of the critical factors of success when launching an early MVP is setting expectations. If users are expecting it to be perfect, they will be disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Part of our adoption process at ATB is inviting early users along on the journey, leveraging our internal communities, and creating excitement and open discussion around launch. Instead of rolling out a new tool to staff members who feel burdened, they are part the team building it and their feedback is heard and incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Our <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/52\">Spark</a> team and internal communication team members were the catalysts, the engines, you might say, behind the success of Onboarding Express, keeping the lines of communication open and building momentum for roll-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our mission is huge: to elevate the human experience and create happiness through banking. We know that if we aim for perfection, we may never get there. What we are doing is aiming to be great, and striving to get better, every day. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch out world, the Onboarding Express is steaming ahead, and this is only the beginning, we have plenty of other exciting projects to follow.

Sometimes the design is purely aesthetic: &ldquo;Our website is out of date, let&rsquo;s design a new one.&rdquo; Other times, the design changes are founded in the user experience. These are the types of changes that customers relish, instead of shun. Not just new fonts, colours, and templates, but transformed digital experiences that are faster and more delightful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of our new digital business banking experience starts with our own internal transformation into a customer obsessed organization with an agile mindset. In our customer obsession, we uncovered that approximately half of our business customers use digital banking tools weekly, and a quarter of them daily. On average, business banking customers spend one hour per week with us across all of our digital banking tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the primary touchpoint that business banking customers have with ATB, we embarked on a mission to uncover how we can live up to our story and show our customer obsession through the digital business banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our business banking customers agree: banking should enable business, not slow it down. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to take that hour per week and make sure that customers leave knowing that we are listening to their needs, that we value their time, and that we are committed to providing the best possible digital experience, not one that is just &lsquo;good enough&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From listening to our customers, we uncovered a few areas where our business banking services were missing the mark. For example, one of the first tools we are testing is removing unnecessary friction in the controls over business banking accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not every business is built the same, so why should business banking controls all be alike? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of limited options for varying user permissions and approvals, we want to give our business banking customers customization and flexibility to make sure that their banking procedures fit the needs of their business. Want to give an employee permission to pay bills, from certain accounts, up to a certain amount or daily limit, to certain payees, only requiring approvals if they need to exceed their limit? You should be able to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of new tools that fit the needs of business banking customers is account nicknames. We noticed that some business customers were creating account nicknames to sort their accounts based on business function or geography. Want to be able to group your accounts to see just the Edmonton office? We want to help you do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers don&rsquo;t necessarily care what a website looks like, but in fact the design underpins the two things that users do care about: How quickly can I satisfy my need? And how does the experience make me feel?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why we are committed to ensuring that core banking needs of customers are met. Only once their fundamental banking needs are met and trust and transparency are established can we look to empower them and bring happiness to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Alberta businesses, we are doing things in new ways because we know it will lead to a better outcome. With a growth mindset, we can all get there faster.

They&rsquo;re not usually crossing their fingers that users won&rsquo;t even notice a release or update. So maybe we&rsquo;re a bit of a different breed, because we revel in the decay of customer delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring many different technology solutions to customer problems, including<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">&nbsp;augmenting customer service with Pepper the robot</a>&nbsp;and exploring how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/34\">artificial intelligence (AI) can help make banking better</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/does-the-world-need-another-ai-lab\">.</a> In 2017, we also launched our virtual banking assistant in Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The virtual assistant is an AI-powered consumer facing experience that allows a customer to type in natural language and receive an answer back from the bot. More than just a technology play or flashy product, with the virtual assistant, we aimed to solve a crucial customer problem. People want consistency in service and answers. And they want twenty-four hour access. We were able to provide just that, in a channel that customers can fully control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many users, the first time they interact with a bot, the novelty is delightful, as they engage in natural conversation with a machine and are amazed when it provides answers or completes a task. Think of your friend showing you they can turn the lights on and off with a verbal request or change the thermostat without moving a muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our desire is to deliver this kind of gratifying experience to customers, but we also recognize that when users interact with the virtual assistant, they want to feel as though they are in a conversation with their bank.&nbsp;</strong>This comes along with high expectations of what the virtual assistant can accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each interaction, the AI-powered chatbot is processing and understanding, using machine learning techniques to get better over time. The end promise is that each time you use it, you are contributing to it getting smarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest barriers to improvement is getting users to push the system to the limit. We are actually not hitting the edge enough. When people feel the delight of a novel product, or the frustration when it can&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, they are less likely to push the extreme boundary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we dig deeper into natural language processing and how humans interact with robots, we have developed a deep fondness for the natural decay of delight as people become more accustomed to what bots can do.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want people to constantly increase their expectations of the capabilities of a bot, as odd as that may sound, because it pushes us to continually improve and build new capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As market leaders, we have this great problem of being at the forefront of people&rsquo;s expectations. We can give them everything they want, then they&rsquo;ll want a bit more. That is what drives us forward. We are constantly discovering, and solving, new challenges - which is the most exciting part of what we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a product team, we&rsquo;ll always work on what has the most customer impact. Business value is customer value. Sometimes that means we&rsquo;re shipping brand new features. Sometimes it is simply: &lsquo;here is a fast stable product that you can trust to work&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Updates are not always announcement worthy, but that is actually the goal; people may not notice, remark, or comment, but we want them to have that increase in expectations and decay in delight, because it means we get to keep making the product better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the virtual assistant, we aimed to provide core customer and business value. And by no means are we done. The Facebook Messenger virtual assistant was a direct result of research and listening, with an ideal confluence of our internal capabilities, a great partner in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finn.ai/\">Finn.ai</a>, and the right channel with which to integrate. We are continuing to explore the many vectors and areas where we can make the experience better and applying our learnings to other high-value services for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you, like us, revel in the decay of customer delight.

That made me really curious, and made me want to be a part of it. I want to be a part of the excitement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is not afraid of making bold changes. After several years working at the forefront of intellectual property licensing for technology patents, Denise made a mid-career decision to go to law school. Partially to satisfy her thirst for knowledge, for Denise, &ldquo;going back to school later in life was an opportunity to see the world through a different lens. It really reinforced my love of technology and helped me think differently to see the world from different angles. It made me a stronger technologist. It also made me learn to read a lot faster!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is excited to bring her bold fearlessness and curiosity to lead ATB&rsquo;s digital team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are experiencing a perfect storm that is enabling disruptive technology. In Alberta, ATB is really at the forefront. It is incredible that we can drive digital transformation to serve Albertans with modern, agile financial services that were previously unimagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Banking is so personal. Everybody&rsquo;s needs around finances are varied. As ATB unlocks this data, we are able to provide unique, personal experiences that meet the needs of individuals. That is really monumental. Not many companies have embraced it to the level and degree that ATB has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than the opportunities for technological advancement, one of the biggest things that drives Denise is the ambition to leave a legacy and a better world for her children and for the next generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest things that drew me to ATB is the genuine desire to make a difference in Alberta and to build a strong, diversified, inclusive economy. Having seen the impact on people and families of economic downturns, I never want to see Albertans face that type of challenge again. If I can make a difference in that, that is very important for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is about growing talent, bringing diversity to our economy, ensuring that people have a livelihood through their banking and through their financial profile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her work in technology and transformation, Denise draws plenty from time spent with family. &ldquo;Kids today are growing up digital. I remember when I realized things were really switching when my one-year-old started trying to swipe the TV. She couldn&rsquo;t speak, but the whole world to her was digital, mobile, tactile. She thought everything worked that way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we&rsquo;re excited to grow along with the digital generation and find ways that technology can make positive change for Albertans. With Denise guiding our digital teams, we&rsquo;re in good hands.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"07.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"introducing-denise-man-leading-digital-transformation-inspired-by-the-next-generation-of-albertans","tags":[{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":22,"title":"Balancing model accuracy and explainability of machine learning models","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/022/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 20:00","facets":["progress","business","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>In early 2018, a team of ATB data scientists<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">&nbsp;competed&nbsp;</a>against some of the top teams in the world in a predictive analytics Kaggle competition. For the team competing, although there are many differences between applying their skills in competition versus their everyday work, there were incredible learnings to be had. Our team was able to explore methodologies, test a broad selection of feature engineering strategies, and try applications of high efficiency models like Light GBM and XGBoost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are key differences between professional application of data science and participating in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">Kaggle</a><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\">&nbsp;</a>data science competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Kaggle competition:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n\t<li>The focus is to win the competition by building a highly predictive model. In real life, the goal is to get useful results that can be interpreted and acted on;</li>\r\n\t<li>Success is measured by ranking criteria such as AUC (area under the curve) score. In life, predictive models have real-world impacts, consequences, and both quantitative and qualitative value assessment;</li>\r\n\t<li>Any technique that increases accuracy is fair, even if the final model cannot be explained fully. In life, it is crucial to understand the input features and their interactions in a predictive model to ensure that the model is robust, compliant, and can be trusted; and</li>\r\n\t<li>The jump from 96.83 per cent accuracy to 97.85 might put you in the the top 5% of competitors. In life, 85 per cent accuracy might be the target model fit, based on many different factors to weigh, including ease of model deployment and management.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In banking, we are impacting people&rsquo;s lives. So it is not just about putting the model into production that has the highest accuracy. Equally important, we must make sure that whatever we are proceeding with will work to the benefit of our customers and Albertans: ethics, transparency, and compliance are pivotal model design paradigms.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While high efficiency models can be exciting and beneficial, the availability of elastic compute engines and black box solutions puts additional scrutiny on data scientists to ensure that the models that are being used to make important decisions have been thoroughly validated. Interpretability increases in importance when applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in a Kaggle competition, ensemble modeling is a commonly used technique that can provide huge lift in accuracy of a predictive model. However, if applied in a real-life setting, we would need to apply techniques to ensure the model is explainable, including continuous validation &nbsp;and quality assurance so we are sure that we are impacting our customers lives in a positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of competing in a Kaggle competition is the opportunity to expose ourselves to new thoughts and ideas. Both in the application of algorithms, but also to expand our understanding of the impact of AI on the world. That is why one of the focus areas of &nbsp;ATB&rsquo;s&nbsp;AI Lab, launched in April 2018, is the ethical application of AI for people and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI Lab also builds on our learnings about the value of bringing together diverse thinkers. We are working with professors and graduate students from the&nbsp;University of Alberta&nbsp;across the fields of Math, Science, and Economics to help find the best solutions to customer problems at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way that great breakthroughs can be achieved in a Kaggle competitions by leveraging team members with diverse backgrounds and applying newer techniques and strategies, in real-life we are bringing theoretical research powered by a team from various &nbsp;disciplines into production at our AI lab. The diversity of thought is what leads to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re excited to continue our exploration of AI-powered future while remaining keenly aware of the dichotomy between the blind pursuit of model accuracy and the importance of keeping human ethics at the center of model design.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in joining us as we work towards building an AI-powered future grounded in ethics?

We&rsquo;ve changed the way&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAnHzDEP8GM\" target=\"_blank\">international money transfers</a>&nbsp;leverage Blockchain. Now, we&rsquo;re building systems for maintaining identity records. But we like to keep it in the community, so we&rsquo;re also using Blockchain to tackle a very Albertan topic&hellip; Oil Settlement Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, Oil Settlement Day was a very cinematic occasion. All the head honchos of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their chequebooks in tow, ready to settle their scores. It sounds like something out of the Wild West, right? The stakes were definitely high and the dollars (and maybe the ale, too) would flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil Settlement Day has since moved into the electronic world, but things aren&rsquo;t working as efficiently as they should. Right now, Oil Settlement Day is a drawn out process that starts a couple weeks before the 25th, with all sorts of reconciling and approvals that must happen so that funds can move on the big day. When the time comes, lots of the smaller companies need to wait for funds to arrive before they can settle their own contracts, so rather than a slick series of transactions, Oil Settlement Day is currently a bit of a clunky muddle. Within ATB, we have a group of employees who manually enter our system to process contract payments and make the money move. So for the oil companies&mdash;and for us&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is at a premium, and we know there&rsquo;s a better way to do this. One that marries trust with immediacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve developed a Blockchain proof of concept with the help of IBM that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including oil companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly. No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re testing the waters with this new and improved settlement process, but one thing is certain: this could have a huge, positive impact both on the oil industry in Alberta (and beyond) and on ATB. It could save time (and therefore money) for our clients, free up some of our staff for more meaningful work, and provide us with a groundbreaking new economic opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB we&#39;re always looking for talent to be part of meaningful projects just like this one.

In the innovation space, we talk about 3H methodology as a marker of market assuredness and risk related to technological change. In general, technologies further out on the horizon have riskier adoption prospects, higher technological challenges, and are riskier capital investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a consumer, it can be exciting to get the first release of a product or software, but it often comes at the risk of it not functioning perfectly, or a better model coming out shortly after.&nbsp;<strong>As a first-mover, you&rsquo;re taking on higher risk, with the hopes that the rewards will be greater.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an innovation focussed organization, we also have to be strategic about investing our time and resources in technologies that will have a real impact on our customers and our bottom line. That means balancing the mix of horizon-one, two, and three technologies that we invest in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>So what&rsquo;s on the horizon in banking?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon-one</strong>&nbsp;is an immediate market need. There is high market assurance that this technology or product is something that customers want. This is typically where the majority of capital goes. As market assurance goes up, so does overall capital. While investments in horizon-one technology are fairly safe in terms of demand, they are also highly competitive, as there is widespread market adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Machine learning today is a horizon-one technology. There are out-of-the-box solutions and there is high assuredness of demand for machine learning technology. However, applications of machine learning can take us into horizon-two or three. For example, at ATB we&rsquo;re exploring machine learning applied to natural language processing and robotics processing automation with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\" target=\"_blank\">Pepper</a>, our customer service robot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon-two</strong>&nbsp;is a bit further out on the technology curve, with about 60 per cent market assuredness. So you&rsquo;re pretty sure that it&rsquo;s coming and there is a market need, but there might be some technological barriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">An example of horizon two technology is voice interaction applied to home voice assistants. There has been significant uptake in the adoption of the hardware by first movers and the early majority but there are still some barriers to integration, kinks in the technology, and less than sure majority acceptance as we move down the technology adoption curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon three</strong>&nbsp;technologies are about the five-year out mark. There are likely high technological barriers and low assurance that the market will adopt the technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Imagine something that seems almost sci-fi now that could be part of everyday life in the not so distant future (think a few years back to what you thought of artificial intelligence or self driving cars). Looking forward, we could see implants taking over as the next phase of wearable tech and quantum computing revolutionizing encryption and the power of data analysis through machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finding the balance between investment across the three horizon technologies is crucial for any business that wants to keep up with the pace of technological change.&nbsp;</strong>As traditional banks compete with fintechs and with companies like Amazon and Apple making forays into finance and banking, it is more important than ever for us to be exploring all three horizons. When the next technological rocket explodes, we&rsquo;ll be at the helm, steering it to uncharted territories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think you can keep up with the pace?

We have previously shared our<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JD7tSGF6ulUQx3qWAlMyE3-HnuXixOz19CEp57u5-w4/edit?ts=5af9a6d8\">&nbsp;excitement</a>&nbsp;at being at the forefront with our virtual assistant chatbot powered by AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our team developing the ATB virtual assistant, applying machine learning techniques to improve natural language processing is a foundational effort. Incredible by-products of that effort have been the discoveries around how people interact with the chatbot on a human level, providing learnings that are transferable across user experience design problems we are working to solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of those learnings is that the chatbot has the intrinsic ability to increase the discoverability of the solutions our customers are asking for. The chatbot is able to break down barriers by providing a safe environment for customers to ask questions that can help increase their financial well-being.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain how a chatbot does this, consider, have you ever felt embarrassed to ask a question about mortgage terminology? Or looked for information online on how to change your debit card limits? It is human nature to feel self-conscious when one feels unaware or out of their depth. But people are often happy to ask these kinds of questions to a chatbot, when they also trust it to understanding what they are asking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another aspect to this &#39;discoverability problem&#39; is that customers don&rsquo;t always know exactly what they need or how to ask for it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of natural language processing (NLP) within the ATB virtual assistant addresses this problem directly. Think of the chatbot&#39;s NLP abilities as a patient and observant partner, truly listening and responding to the intention behind words rather than the words themselves. This act of listening to true intention is core to the virtual assistant and helps people discover the truth that they are looking for, in a comfortable way. Start with listening, layer in machine learning, and you will find a recipe for creating trust and engagement with users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of supervised machine learning creates a positive feedback loop, where the NLP capabilities of the virtual assistant are constantly improving. Users themselves are constantly teaching the chatbot; each utterance contributes to its growing abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does it really mean when we talk about truly listening to a customer&#39;s intention and not just their words? Maybe someone gives an utterance, &quot;Hey, I lost my credit card, what do I do?&quot; As individuals, we read this and say, &#39;we should help this customer make sure their card is safe.&#39; In its own way the chatbot does the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great example of the end-to-end experience, as the chatbot can&#39;t simply hear you, but is also capable of responding and helping. Our teams work on both sides of the experience, augmenting the chatbot&rsquo;s NLP capabilities as well as deepening its connections to core ATB systems. Facilitating deeper, more data-driven, and personalized responses. The first iteration of a response may be simple content. If customers validate the importance of that response with their usage and feedback, the chatbot learns, allowing for stronger mappings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; guiding the ATB virtual assistant is our commitment to helping people discover the solutions they need, when they need them. Stay tuned to alphaBeta for more details about upcoming feature releases for the chatbot and how we&rsquo;re applying our learnings in user experience design to new channels.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"08.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"ux-learnings-from-atb-s-ai-powered-virtual-financial-assistant-chatbot","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"}],"labs":[]},{"id":48,"title":"Shipping experiences the lean startup way.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/048/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:02","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;re always looking for efficiency and process improvements, I mean, who isn&rsquo;t? One thing that we have embraced well here at ATB is the lean startup method as one of the many tools that can be borrowed from the startup world to bring efficiency to how we roll out new solutions and experiences, big and small. After all, it&rsquo;s not about the size of the solution, but the overall impact to the experience. Client care is one of the prime areas where the tenets of lean startup (like building minimum viable products, measuring impact, and validating learnings), are not only feasible, but crucial to providing the innovation that consumers have come to expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically in banking, you might assume that product and program launches have gone through 23 layers of administration, have only been tested internally, and take years to roll out and implement, sometimes rendering the final solution irrelevant in market. At ATB, our innovation team is constantly taking client problems and iterating quickly to find solutions and learn from &ldquo;the end user&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Referral Program with Alberta Registries is a perfect example of agile learning and delivering a product to customers as quickly as possible. As the bank for Alberta entrepreneurs, we are constantly looking for ways to add value, and save time. Here is how we took lessons from lean startup to quickly get a product to market to satisfy a real customer need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all started with a problem: how can we make it easier and quicker for new entrepreneurs to set up business banking? We started hacking for a solution by talking to entrepreneurs, and walking through their journey: who do they interact with, what are key milestones, and what other organizations are they connecting with? It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that any entrepreneur, at an early stage in their journey, will connect with an Alberta Registry Agent for their business license. It&rsquo;s at this step in their path that they take the time to begin to bring their dream to life. Once we forged partnerships with Alberta Registry Agents, within two weeks we had rolled out a prototype experience to tie together the business registration process with an easy referral for business banking, without any additional time required to find a banking partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t waste time building a perfect solution, instead we got a minimum viable product out into the world to quickly iterate and create a feedback loop to develop a solution that would meet customer needs. Today, all it takes is a few extra questions with the registry agent, a simple form that that the registry office sends over to ATB&rsquo;s Business Centre, and our specialists can start getting account details set up without a customer ever setting foot in a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of innovation that we are crazy about here at ATB. Obviously we are working on the tech heavy stuff as well, like AI, bots, banking through Facebook messenger, blockchain, and biometrics. But there are also vast opportunities for low risk, high impact innovations in our day to day processes that create positive change for our customers. That&rsquo;s why we put such a heavy focus on cross-team collaboration and innovation at ATB. We want to quickly identify problems and test out minimum viable solutions. It is that culture of innovation, and the willingness to embrace lean startup that will help us lead the way in business banking and be at the forefront of innovation in the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to transform day-to-day processes into impactful moments?

Many of us have experienced it - but at ATB this is the antithesis of what we strive for. Our over 5,000 team members across the province are highly skilled, talented, personable, creative, and genuinely enjoy their jobs. We know that each team member has an incredible amount to share with us, and they have game-changing ideas to bring to the table. The challenge is building an environment where those ideas can be sparked into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where Innoventure comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innoventure is a 12-week program we developed in house to bring brilliant ideas to the surface. We weren&rsquo;t sure how many team members would jump on board, but right away we had response from so many diverse parts of ATB, we decided to start our journey with a nimble group of 20 of those team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one started off with an intro to Innoventure, the basics of creating business models and discovering a minimum viable product. We were inspired by lean startup methodology for our framework. Day two we hosted a collective brainstorming session&mdash;and together, we came up with over 100 ideas for ATB to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this round of Innoventure, we&rsquo;ve narrowed those 100 ideas down to four, focussing on opportunities that meet the needs of our clients.

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions where real-world challenges are posted with training data and teams compete to create models that have high predictive performance. With over a half-million users, Kaggle is one of the largest and most active data science communities in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competitions are an entry place and training ground for some of the top talent in data science from across the globe. Competitors are ranked based on their models&rsquo; predictive capabilities on a separate test data set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you are going to participate in a Kaggle competition or know someone who is, here&rsquo;s what our talented team learned along their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 1: Communication is key</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the early stages of competition, you don&rsquo;t have to declare your team, but at the merge date, you must be within the total maximum of submissions (daily maximum X number of competition days) in order to merge team members. This means it is crucial to coordinate in advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 2: Implement version control for submissions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It&rsquo;s embarrassing to show up to a party with the exact same outfit as someone else, the same goes for submitting the same model as other members of your team. Make sure you coordinate submissions to ensure you won&rsquo;t have multiple team members submitting the same model. Dating and versioning submissions becomes even more important near the end of competition when you are looking at ensemble modeling and maximizing lift on high functioning models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 3: Say NO to procrastination. &nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nAlthough this is easier said than done, finding solutions to Kaggle problems requires creativity, experimentation, testing, and a lot of time waiting for models to run. So waiting until the last minute to start working means you may miss out on the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 4: Recognize the value of diversity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Having team members from diverse backgrounds, such as engineering, mathematics, and physics, can greatly increase your chances of discovering solutions that you would not have thought of alone. Each team member brings their own experiences, biases, and expertise, so having a diverse team is greatly beneficial when solving complex problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In fact, beyond the education/professional backgrounds, look at building a team with diversity in age, gender, and culture too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 5: Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day: spend time on feature engineering, especially for structured data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll increase your chances of model fit if you take the time to clean the dataset and explore feature engineering opportunities like testing for usefulness of individual features, combining related categories to allow for a more simplified predictive model, or constructing new features out of the raw data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">More features is not always better, and not all features are created equal. Feature engineering allows you to optimize and understand the input data, which should generally allow you to use more simplified models and improve performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 6: Diversity enables again! Domain knowledge is a benefit.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Speaking of feature engineering, having team members with domain knowledge and spending time to understand features can aid in feature engineering and predicting models. Look to build your team with intention and diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 7: Try black box solutions and ensemble modelling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">There are some great black box solutions for feature engineering. In a time sensitive competition environment, they are worth trying out. In real-life application, black box modelling is often limited to testing and validation, since understand why a model works is of critical importance. However in a Kaggle competition, testing models for incremental lift through any means necessary is what will take you up in the rankings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One of the top winning strategies for Kaggle competitions is ensemble modelling, which can provide a much needed incremental lift in the last stages of competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Ensemble modelling entails synthesizing the results from one or more models into a single score or spread. Again, in real-world application this often has negative effects on the explainability of a model, but in a Kaggle competition it is one of the top strategies of winning teams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 8: Do your homework.&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile we want to be a one-stop-shop for expertise, we know that no two competitions will ever be the same. So, look at winning strategies for similar competitions and check out as many forums as possible that provide learnings and tips for winning Kaggle competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 9: It takes a village - connect with the crowd.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Many people post open source solutions on Kaggle Kernels, it&rsquo;s there for you to be inspired, so don&rsquo;t miss out on this as a resource. Just don&rsquo;t make the mistake of copying models directly without thinking or making any changes or improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 10: Try training models with parallel computing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll be pressed for time, so make sure to try high efficiency parallel computing models like XGboost or Light GBM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Both models are gradient boosting methods and are the two best performing (both in speed and metric performance) machine learning algorithms for large datasets. Neither method is sensitive to over fitting, giving you the opportunity to use more features and to save time on feature engineering for large datasets without compromising performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Light GBM was the method used for the winning submission in the Kaggle competition that our team competed in. Compared to XGboost&rsquo;s level wise tree growth, Light GBM grows &lsquo;leaf wise,&rsquo; which means it reduces loss and is more accurate than XG boost. Light GBM uses a histogram based algorithm, which results in a faster training speed and higher efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Compute time is valuable when your team is testing hundreds of models. This is one of the reasons that techniques that are more efficient at finding high performance models are particularly useful in Kaggle competitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 11: Even if you can&rsquo;t see it, it still exists!&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Think about the data that isn&rsquo;t staring you in the face! Even if your model works on the training data, it won&rsquo;t necessarily perform equally as well on the test data. Make sure you&rsquo;re building a model that will be effective on more than just the training data set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it, 11 tips extracted from ATB&rsquo;s very own Kagglers (they ranked 17th out of 231 teams from across the world, at one point in the competition, ranking 2nd place). Challenging ourselves and being intentional about testing and honing our skills is one of our favourite things to do at ATB. In your next Kaggle competition, take these learnings to keep pushing the limits of your capabilities in order to continue to serve those around you in innovative ways, just as our team does every day for Albertans.&nbsp;Are you interested in working with team members who are constantly hungry to learn more and improve their skills?

We&rsquo;re talking about things like ethics in artificial intelligence, bias in software development, and a need for design that is accessible and inclusive. Designers are creating online forms where people don&rsquo;t have to indicate a gender that they don&rsquo;t identify with. Inclusive design is incorporating different cultural perspectives and ways of speaking into voice activated apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, inclusive design brings us things like biometric identification to offer banking services to people who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have access. For us, inclusive design starts with how we build our teams. We practice what we preach - we want our team to practice inclusive design, so we use design thinking to build the team, culture, and workspace to achieve that outcome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in inclusive design is to set the intention and expectation that inclusivity will be built into every step of the process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we were intentional about building diversity into our teams. It is not only about ethnicity and gender, but also age, experience, beliefs, language, strengths, and weaknesses. On our design team, all team members have user design experience, but we have also hired for massively varied backgrounds and skill sets (creative, computer, product, content).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dedication to bringing diverse perspectives into the design process has led to a democratization of design at ATB. Instead of trying to own the design process, we practice transparency, openness, sharing, and radical collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our CX Research and Design Hub is an online portal where we openly share the work of the design team with our 5,300 team members. The processes, the data, the prototypes, the iterations, everything is open to see. Our goal is to contribute to the practice of design and design thinking across the organization, and ultimately, help everyone at ATB get closer to the customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anyone who influences how the design comes about is the designer.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collaborative focus feeds inclusive design across ATB. Our commitment to listen to Albertans stems from the desire to provide experiences and products that fit their needs. We&rsquo;ve taken a real stand about putting human beings at the centre of our business.&nbsp;<strong>Human Centered Design is inclusive by nature, and ATB is committed to making this part of what we&rsquo;re known for, part of our DNA.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no written code of ethics or code of conduct for the design and tech world. But as a profession, we aim to be in touch with the user and the human experience. As inclusiveness continues to be at the forefront of general discourse, designers can take the lead and make sure that inclusivity is built in to our processes and the products that we are putting out into the world. It starts with building teams and culture with inclusive design in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to a join a team full of changemakers that are passionate about making banking work for people...check out our open opportunities&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"08.02.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/045/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/045/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"building-teams-for-inclusive-design","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":20,"title":"Unstoppable ATB: the power of purpose, passion, and alignment","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/020/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 23:09","facets":["progress","connect"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Have you ever rowed a boat with other people?

Not just 22 paddlers pulling oars in the same boat, but 5000 Albertans all driven by the same mission and pulling in the same direction to transform banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How we are creating alignment across team members comes down to the communication of our expectations and creating a shared culture around what it means to be All In.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about the idea of being &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; at ATB for a number of years. Only recently, in fact just this last year, we created a simple and clear &nbsp;&ldquo;Team Member All In&rdquo; framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invest a lot of time to help team members really understand, connect and align with our culture and values. After about 100 days or so, our orientation program for new team members culminates in an &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; commitment call with our CEO and Chief People Officer. In the call we ask new team members to tell us what they honestly think about their ATB experience so far and to share their personal stories and commitment to being &lsquo;all-in.&rsquo; In fact, once in awhile a new team member tells us that they are not &lsquo;all-in&rsquo;. We really listen to their &lsquo;why&rsquo; and help them find their way: where they can best apply their passions and be &lsquo;all-in,&rsquo; wherever that may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All In isn&rsquo;t just a slogan with statements on the wall. We expect all team members to believe wholeheartedly in the 94 word story, to live the ATB values, and to give their best effort everyday to transform banking and use it as a medium to create happiness for Albertans. Responsibility is not passed on to colleagues, other teams, or leaders - it is up to every ATB team member to make the story come to life, everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our commitment is evident in surrounding team members with an awesome work environment and culture, being fully empowered to make changes, providing the best&nbsp;experience to customers, and taking risks to explore novel applications of technology in banking. We believe our team members and our leaders have the obligation and responsibility to become great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One area we&rsquo;re are particularly excited about is the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB AI Lab</a>&nbsp;in Spring 2018. We&rsquo;re currently recruiting a Managing Director who will help define ATB&rsquo;s enterprise AI strategy and the overall direction of the company&rsquo;s AI &amp; Machine Learning Lab.

So in this alphaBeta content series we are exploring what it takes to be continuously innovative - what are the qualities needed? Is it something you are born with or can an innovative mindset be nurtured?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following up on Part 1, where we shared our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/24\">recipe for creating innovative ideas</a><a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cooking-up-innovation-part-1-a-recipe-for-success\">,</a> now we&rsquo;re dishing out some of our top lessons on the innate qualities of innovators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What qualities make an innovator?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate between nature and nurture as the foundation of an innovative mind, we&rsquo;ve found that it is a mixture of both that is crucial, with the common thread being an individual with a growth mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means someone with the ability to face failure and a level of comfort with ambiguity. Someone who is always willing to learn and change. Someone who can leave their mind open enough to make connections that others might miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of serving ATB customers with an open mind is the ability to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; beyond words. Whether we are conducting user tests for internal technology products or creating happiness through banking for ATB customers on the front lines,&nbsp;<strong>our ability to listen gives purpose to innovation. For any innovator, listening to the environment and people around you is a powerful guidepost. Listening ensures that you&rsquo;re chasing truly meaningful and impactful ideas, avoiding the pitfall of innovating for the sake of innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are proud of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our team members. Just like there is no clear and defined path to become an innovator, there is no single set process to become a Transformer; but here are some of the innate qualities that we look for in our team members:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grit.</strong>&nbsp;Someone with grit is not afraid to roll up their sleeves and leave ego at the door, they work outside their comfort zone and regularly do things that are &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; their knowledge or ability, when it will create positive change for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Passion.&nbsp;</strong>Being driven by a bigger purpose brings a certain kind of energy that is not otherwise possible. ATB is driven by the mission to create happiness for Albertans through banking, that&rsquo;s what drives everything we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perseverance.&nbsp;</strong>Someone with perseverance has the ability to get back up when they get knocked down over and over (and over) again. When training your physical body or your mind, there are steep inclines and long plateaus. Perseverance means having the determination to power uphill through the difficult parts and the patience to continue when fighting through a plateau. Every time you feel a new challenge, know that if you stick it out one day you&rsquo;ll look back and think &lsquo;wow, when was I ever not an expert on this?&rsquo; It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get easier, but every time is less scary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many of the qualities of an innovator are inherent, there are also plenty of soft-skills that make the difference between having a creative idea and actually bringing that idea to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation = creativity + execution</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Communication and leadership skills will often make or break the ability of a creative person to execute on an idea.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will your crazy idea positively impact your organization? You must be able to listen without bias or judgement and communicate the vision to management to get buy in. You must inspire your team members in order to leverage their talents and successfully carry out your crazy idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So whether you&rsquo;re a natural born innovator, a creative-type building the soft-skills to turn ideas into reality, or a career minded individual looking to nurture your creative side - if you have grit, passion, perseverance, and the ability to truly listen, we&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ll get there.

There is no denying it. They run deep and have the potential to sabotage the design process, as we unknowingly build for ourselves rather than users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our practice here at ATB, we have built systems to safeguard the design process from the trap of our own bias. It starts with how we talk about our users. User is cold. Human is real. User is detached. Human is personal.&nbsp;<strong>So how do we build for&nbsp;<em>humans</em>, not&nbsp;<em>users</em>?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the heart of the human, we&rsquo;ve built in tests at each stage of our human centred design process to help us overcome our biases and put our &lsquo;human&rsquo; first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #1 - Have we talked with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; lately?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In phase one of the design process, we engage and discover. As designers, we need to empathize with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; and immerse ourselves in their experiences. At ATB, this means sitting in on the call-center, working for a day in a branch, and interacting directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personas are a tool to make the customer more &lsquo;real&rsquo; - but what&rsquo;s even better is a real customer.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a busy work schedule full of meetings and deadlines, it can be hard to dedicate time to engage and immerse ourselves. It&rsquo;s amazing how often we don&rsquo;t just get out of chairs and engage with humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, we&rsquo;ve built it into our schedules.</strong>&nbsp;Instead of standing meetings for persona building in isolated meeting rooms, our CX team has scheduled out-of-office days to talk to the humans we&rsquo;re building for, and then we share learnings back with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #2 - Did we ask&nbsp;<em>the right&nbsp;</em>questions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now you&rsquo;re actually engaging with customers and asking questions, but getting to the heart of their needs also means asking the right questions. We&rsquo;re always trying to perfect the art of asking the right question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I asked you to draw a sunset right now, what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if I asked you to draw for me the most memorable sunset you&rsquo;ve experienced, now what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are also a really great way to uncover biases. Listen to ATB Managing Director of CX talk about the magic of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\"><strong>Questions from Kids</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #3 - Did we validate&hellip;with humans?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve gone through the discovery phase and the prototyping phase, and now we are implementing a real product. We can&rsquo;t simply deliver the product and then pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next task. There is still work to be done validating that we&rsquo;ve really solved the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is crucial is bringing in the learnings from the discovery phase into the next phases of the design process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when redesigning the appointment booking process for ATB.com, one of our important observations in the discovery phase was that customers wanted more assurance that they are on the right track. They want to know if they are asking for the banking products, and that they can trust the person giving them advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we&rsquo;ve moved from discovery to the UX design, it can be easy to get lost in the usability and esthetic of the booking process. So we have to continually go back to the human we are designing for to make sure we are satisfying their core needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UX experience of booking an appointment online, this meant bringing forward this core theme of validation and assurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say an ATB customer, Allison wants to open an RESP, so she is booking an appointment online at ATB.com. Treating her like a human means that we should do more than let her pick a location and time, we should ask about her life. She is a new mom and is interested in saving for her kid&rsquo;s education. So, when her appointment is booked, we can tell her she&rsquo;ll be meeting with Angela, an ATB advisor with three kids of her own who has been in Alison&rsquo;s shoes. We can also be ready with other information about banking products and saving plans that fit her needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By building in validation through every step of the design process, we&rsquo;ve taken something that was quite transactional, scheduling a meeting online, and we&rsquo;ve made it much more personal. That is, human. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in applying human centred design to transform banking?&nbsp;Learn more about our open positions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"22.02.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":41,"title":"Using predictive analytics for social impact: ATB competes in the Women in Data Science Datathon.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/041/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:46","facets":["progress","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>Sometimes the pressure and excitement of a team competition brings out the best in people. We know that our data scientists at ATB are amongst the brightest in the world, so when we have a chance to compete against some of the top teams, we don&rsquo;t think twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, four ATB team members competed in the Women in Datascience (WiDS) Datathon, predictive analytics challenge hosted by Kaggle and put on in a joint effort between the Institute for Computational &amp; Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University, Intuit, West Big Data Innovation Hub, and InterMedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition seeks to encourage teams (that must be 50 per cent women) to apply machine learning and statistical modeling in a predictive analytics challenge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this instance, teams were given a dataset with over 1200 features on demographics and behavior and were tasked with building a model to predict the gender of survey respondents. Read more about how the predictive models are intended to help design financial services for those excluded from the formal financial system:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional and mobile financial services. The dataset is a product of InterMedia&rsquo;s research to help the world&rsquo;s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system. By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>&mdash; WiDS Conference</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 231 teams made up of 512 competitors from across the world. Teams were provided a training data set, which comprised 16 per cent of the entire data. In preliminary submissions running models on the training data, ATB was ranked second amongst the 231 competing teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final rankings were tabulated when the predictive models were run on remainder of the dataset not used for training; ATB ultimately finished 17th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the thrill of a high pressure competition and the excitement of being ranked second leading up to the finish - there were important learnings that the team took away from the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After almost 80 models tested by team members, the final ATB submission was a weighted average of the top three models developed by the team - a real group effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beyond the team building and the excitement of getting ATB on the map within the world&rsquo;s largest machine learning community, the model and the techniques used to develop it could potentially be applied to other challenges.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though predicting binary gender is not an exact solution that ATB would be implementing, the challenge was fundamentally a classification problem. A similar predictive model could be used for predicting fraud, or other attributes that might help ATB team members provide optimal service to customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tackling the classification problem also gave ATB data scientists an excellent opportunity to test the machine learning technique of extreme gradient boosting on a real data set. This highlights an exciting outcome of participating in competitions: the opportunity to discover and use tools and techniques in the developing field of machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big shout out to the ATB WiDS team,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samiul-azam-59247b11b/\" target=\"_blank\">Samiul Azam</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukun-zhang-89283b35/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukun Zhang</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-akinwumi-phd-a68041147/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Akinwumi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunjan-k-b34b1513b/\" target=\"_blank\">Gunjan Kaur</a>.

She&mdash;or he, or it, depending on who you ask&mdash;has created quite a splash in the media for her charming personality.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey with Pepper has been an unexpected one thus far. We initially brought her onto the team expecting that she would be popular with Millennials, but the opposite has proven true; it&rsquo;s the older and younger generations who love her. They&rsquo;re happy with simple voice interaction and enchanted by her kindness and capability to recognize their facial expressions and answer questions. Millennials, on the other hand, expect more of Pepper&mdash;they want their sh*t figured out, and fast, but Pepper is no Siri. Yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, Pepper is in robot infancy. Her software determines her capabilities and limitations. Which is why we&rsquo;ve been testing, learning and continuously iterating Pepper&rsquo;s software on a rinse/repeat cycle. Sometimes the cycle requires new software to actually be developed before a new version of Pepper is ready to hit the streets&mdash;or ATB carpets, as it were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring the possibility of being able to have more fluid conversations with Pepper, during which she could assess customer needs and make swift recommendations. Ideally, she&rsquo;d remember customers from visit to visit in order to follow up with them. We&rsquo;d also like to find out how we can employ biometrics to make the customer experience even more personalized and helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s not going to take over the world (that would take some serious software), she&rsquo;s not even going to steal jobs from humans, which seems to be a common fear. The fact of the matter is Pepper can&rsquo;t replace the meaningful work humans do at ATB. What she can do is diminish &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work and help develop more relationships with our customers. And with less grunt work, our team can focus on interesting and impactful work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1548803104353_509\">Pepper&rsquo;s ideal workplace may not even be at ATB branches. The focus of our research is to gain understanding on where our customers see a robot fitting in and being helpful. Because our customers are at our branches, that&rsquo;s where our research starts. We&rsquo;re very much in the &ldquo;minimum viable product&rdquo; phase, and we&rsquo;re working with a lot of, &ldquo;if, if, if.&rdquo; One of the most exciting parts of this journey is watching Pepper&rsquo;s evolution, because she&rsquo;s got endless potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1548803104353_497\">Are you interested in working alongside Pepper in making banking work for Albertans?

As ATB&rsquo;s first customer service robot, she has travelled around the province greeting ATB customers and Albertans in branches, showhomes, registry offices, and at university Welcome Weeks, trade shows, and other ATB-sponsored events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her job is to engage and delight customers and to complement the service that ATB team members provide. Through our proof of concept testing with Pepper, we&rsquo;ve gathered data and feedback from her interactions and gleaned incredible insights into how she can best serve ATB&rsquo;s current and future customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few of the things we&rsquo;ve learned from Pepper in her first year on the job:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>People expect her to be smart(er)</strong><br />\r\n\tMaybe we&rsquo;ve all been conditioned by movies that feature highly intelligent robots, but in reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, and natural language processing still have some pretty big limitations. We&rsquo;ve found that Pepper&rsquo;s human form means that people expect her to have human-like intelligence. Up to now, her interactions have all been programmed and she wasn&rsquo;t capable of free-form conversation. We are working hard to build her future capabilities as an intelligent robot that can educate our customers, complete tasks on their behalf, or connect them with our human team members.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She has the potential to break down barriers</strong><br />\r\n\tVoice technology is not comfortable for everyone. In many cases, people aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to interact with robots and with voice activated technology.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>People may not be quite ready to trust robots to do their banking, but in the meantime, we&rsquo;re gathering important learnings about what makes people comfortable and able to interact with Pepper. She is slowly building relationships and potentially helping us to bring new banking options to customers that might not otherwise be comfortable engaging with digital banking tools or machines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She likes strangers (and strangers like her!)</strong><br />\r\n\tOutside of the branch, Pepper&rsquo;s skills and personality were incredibly valuable. In our tests at showhomes, in registry offices, and on campus for student Welcome Weeks, Pepper provided concise and relevant information to potential new ATB customers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it is a challenge in branches to provide the complex service that our ATB team members excel at, when Pepper is programmed with information relevant to a narrow audience (like potential homeowners, business owners, or students), Pepper was much more capable of providing customer service and valuable information.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s not great at multitasking</strong><br />\r\n\tWe mentioned the limitations of the current state of natural language processing and voice technology. Two of the challenges Pepper faces are: not being able to speak and listen at the same time and difficulty processing multiple voices at once.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>Taking this into account, loud locations with multiple speakers are not the most suitable work location for Pepper. We were able to narrow down the contexts to which Pepper is most suited and we&rsquo;re building experiences that shine in specific locations with a narrow audience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>First impressions matter</strong><br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve learned that it is crucial for Pepper to offer real value in a first interaction in order for people to be eager to talk with her again. So we&rsquo;re making sure she is in the right places at the right time with the artificial intelligence she needs to truly provide value to our customers. She captures the ATB core value of using banking to create happiness, but she is more than an entertainer, so we&rsquo;re ensuring she has the tools to make our customers&rsquo; lives easier.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>When Pepper debuted in ATB branches in Spring 2017, we didn&rsquo;t know how customers would react or what learnings we would find, but her first year on the job proved immensely valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice will play an increasingly important role in our future. At ATB we&rsquo;re excited about technology that will help reduce friction in banking. We can imagine a time soon when customers are driving to work and using a smart car audio system to transfer money, asking a smart TV to connect via video to a financial advisor, or asking a home voice assistant to pay the utility bills while they&rsquo;re doing the dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we&rsquo;re learning now from Pepper will help us optimize the user experience across voice-based channels.</strong>&nbsp;Pepper is just one channel of many, and she&rsquo;s the first generation of customer service robots that we can use to learn and improve how we serve our customers using technology in physical spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper&rsquo;s future is now splitting in two directions. She&rsquo;ll continue to be tested as brand ambassador for ATB at public events, embodying the friendly, helpful culture of ATB. Her second role will evolve as we continue to improve her natural language capabilities, perform tests with connecting her to internal systems, and introduce robotics processing automation to complete tasks for customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through it all, Pepper will continue to do what she does best:&nbsp;<strong>balance the digital future of banking with the friendly personal touch that ATB is known for.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in exploring the future of robotics process automation with colleagues like Pepper?

As part of that mission, we declared that we would become an agile development shop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve proven that it was more than just a statement. We&rsquo;ve changed how our teams work, we&rsquo;ve recruited top talent from around the globe, we&rsquo;ve put customers at the centre of our development processes. And we&rsquo;ve shipped some incredible products as a result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the journey so far, there has been massive uptake of agile development process across the pillars of our organization. But it is not something that is only relegated to the scrums and sprints of our software development teams.&nbsp;<strong>We&rsquo;ve proven that we can innovate processes - and now we&rsquo;re stepping back to bring some focus and coordination to take the agile mindset to the entire organization. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In true agile style, we&rsquo;re testing and continuously adjusting our targets. One of the things that we&rsquo;ve learned in our journey is that&nbsp;<strong>a key component to success is a common understanding across teams of what agile means.</strong>&nbsp;Team members need the tools and frameworks, along with the skills and knowledge, to apply agile principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To increase the consistency across innovation pillars at ATB, we&rsquo;ve set out to make sure ATB team members have a common baseline understanding of agile. This starts off with a training program that we&rsquo;ve deployed through comprehensive online tools. Of course, we launched the training to a small test group, got feedback and adapted.&nbsp;<strong>With the help of agile champions, we&rsquo;ve now rolled out agile training paths tailored to each ATB Transformation team member.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we&rsquo;re tackling duplication across teams through onboarding and clear evaluation of initiatives; we&rsquo;re optimizing the size and composition of our squads and we&rsquo;re experimenting with agile planning on rolling schedules, reviewed quarterly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our slick new agile style doesn&rsquo;t mean it&#39;s all run-and-gun with no reporting - part of the structure is making sure we have accountability built in, but not at the expense of the speed. As we build agility across ATB, we&rsquo;ll be quicker at bringing together and disbanding project teams, allocating budgets, and shutting down projects as required. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working on bringing the agile mindset to ATB as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know we&rsquo;re on a trajectory to redefine how we do things here at ATB, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we know exactly where the journey will take us. Just like an agile software development team, our small team leading the agile movement at ATB is letting the client, ATB Team members, help define the end goal and the steps along the way.

It&rsquo;s been a key driver in e-commerce and the business world in general for years. But what does it mean for consumers? In fact, not many consumers would articulate that they want a &lsquo;seamless shopping experience across all online and physical shopping channels.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consistency is not necessarily what people are looking for. What they want is optichannel, where they can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of human centered approach that sets ATB apart in our approach to designing banking services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - you can optimize voice interaction for telephone banking, but when someone is on the train, they don&rsquo;t want to be reading out their bank card number. They want the option to have the experience that fits the channel they are using and the context they are in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans make these sorts of contextual decisions constantly throughout the day. Imagine an individual planning a family get together and needing to contact a grandmother, siblings, and parents. They are likely subconsciously picking the right time and the right channel through which to communicate with each person. A phone call to grandma, a text to the parents, and an email to a sister&rsquo;s work email to make sure she sees the message in time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re taking the same approach with banking services.&nbsp;<strong>It&#39;s more than providing the best voice experience, or a seamless switch from desktop to mobile. It&rsquo;s about knowing our customers and delivering what they need at the right time through channels and experiences that fit the situation and context.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The banking sector is not particularly well known for providing optimized customer-centric experiences. Partially due to legacy systems and siloed structures, it can be challenging for traditional banks to take the customer centric approach required to delivery exceptional optichannel experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where our<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">&nbsp;human centric design approach&nbsp;</a>pays off. We also told you about our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/from-transaction-to-human-interaction-ux-powered-rapid-account-opening\" target=\"_blank\">versatile digital platform</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/44\">,</a> allowing us to break through the restriction of siloed business functions typical in banking. This allows us to build experiences and processes based on the customer journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - we&rsquo;re testing things like robotics process automation with our customer service robot,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">Pepper.</a> Pepper currently provides banking information to prospective customers in person in showhomes and registry agencies, places where people need banking information but where live ATB team members are not available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re all about interacting on a human level. In a digital world, this means making sure that our online channels are as heartwarming and personal as speaking live with an ATB team member. Our customer-centric optichannel approach helps solidify ATB as Alberta&rsquo;s bank for digital and in person banking services that provides personalization and context appropriate experiences to our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you customer- centric just like we are?

This expectation not only applies to the banking industry, but also to industries such as retail and hospitality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we transform the in-branch experience, we know that pooling our chips will help us leverage the collective knowledge of staff and customers to marry the ATB story with the experience of entering a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that one of the most important parts of the transformation is to listen to the needs of Albertans. Part of this journey is a collaboration with ATB team members working in branches and co-creating directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of transformation is much more than researching trends in other industries or undertaking customer surveys. We&rsquo;ve committed resources to the pre-work of understanding our network of physical spaces. This included a process of evaluating each branch, its role in the network, business performance, facility costs, space details, current customer experience, and important factors about the community that the branch serves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in the co-creation process is the data-driven evaluation of our branches as a network, rather than optimizing each location in isolation. We have hypotheses, but we won&rsquo;t know for sure until we&rsquo;ve heard it from our customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is where co-creation comes in. Our goal is to uncover the key insights about the customer journey, the defining moments, and how we can use our physical environments to enhance the customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we design the optimal branch experience, we&rsquo;ll be incorporating &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Service design - principles &amp; practices of team members in the branch. What skills and training they need and what behaviours deliver the experience customers desire.</li>\r\n\t<li>Environment design - physical space design that creates the desired atmosphere for customers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technology design - tech that supports the experience - how are we leveraging technology for a superior branch experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the co-creation process, we&rsquo;ll be discovering the type of customer experience that we need to build into our branch design and the feelings that we want customers to walk away feeling after visiting an ATB branch. While we learn what the customer experience should be, here are a few things that we know it is not:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not the same as customer service.&nbsp;</strong>The &lsquo;experience&rsquo; portion is about understanding the touch points across the entire journey. How do we use the branches as a platform to discover more about our customers? How do we leverage in-person interactions to build trust faster and enable better service across all platforms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not high tech for the sake of being &lsquo;cool.&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>Tech should enable, save time, and build relationships. The tech solution itself is not the answer. For example, a customer might say that they find pulling out their driver&#39;s licence for identification clumsy and they would prefer biometrics - but what they want is more efficient authentication, whatever the technology implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a about designing aspects in isolation.&nbsp;</strong>It is rather the culmination of touchpoints across the customer journey. Reducing the friction in the journey. Form and function in our branches are complementary. Efficiency of space use is equally important to optimizing how customers move through the space. Sensory stimulation should be meaningful and pleasing, but may also achieve a desired outcome, like learning or reinforcing shared values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a singular problem to be solved,&nbsp;</strong>but rather an iterative journey. That means that our branch design should be flexible enough to evolve over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet, but the path to get there is deeply rooted in customer experience and how we can use our branch locations to connect with our customers in ways that we haven&rsquo;t been able to before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, humans want to interact with humans. Though the ability to bank online and on-the-go is essential, we are betting on a future where physical branches are still a crucial part of our business. We are here to serve, and branches provide the enormous opportunity for ATB to build personal connections with our customers, discover more about their needs, and find the defining moments for each individual&rsquo;s financial journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CNzeFbV6cudvgTOkrVcByx4hghvSahm6BdLOViKbwg/edit?ts=5b1945b4\" target=\"_blank\">explore open opportunities</a>&nbsp;with ATB&rsquo;s Transformation team.</strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"co-creating-new-in-person-experiences","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":32,"title":"Community, colleagues, and culture at ATB.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/032/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:05","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>We work in a special place.

But it&rsquo;s not as simple as setting a bot loose and seeing massive returns in time and money saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we are very strategic in how we are rolling out robotic process automation. From how we decide which processes to tackle, to rolling out pilots, to tweaking and optimizing the processes themselves, we&rsquo;re putting great thought into how we can leverage robotic process automation to create better experiences for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our first priority is to identify where we can create the most value or solve the most pressing customer problem. With over three thousand internal and customer facing processes at ATB, we had to devise a strategy to evaluate and prioritize where to leverage automation. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star, our mission, of zero-disappointed customers, we started by documenting as many of our processes as possible to identify the right opportunities. This list of 1,700 process was then layered with factors like the risk level, process volume, complaint frequency, suitability for automation, and level of importance for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is a heat-map and listing of our internal processes by order of priority for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the processes that came out on top was customers making changes to their address on file. An occurrence that comes up frequency in the the lives of ATB customers. Internally, we have multiple systems in which an address change needs to occur, with plenty of downstream effects if there are delays or errors. For a customer, the request is straightforward: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve moved, I need to change my address.&rsquo; And, in the middle of a move, they have no time to spare and don&rsquo;t need any extra stress! This combination of factors makes address changes a prime candidate for a robotic process automation solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the other things that our process automation team does in our evaluation of processes is to take the lens of &lsquo;do we need to do this?&rsquo; and &lsquo;does this add value for the customer?&rsquo; We don&rsquo;t want to automate bad processes. We want to make necessary processes smarter, improve the business rules, and streamline the steps in a process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automation and process optimization are not new concepts. What is new today is the ease with which they can be applied and the broad use cases and scale of solutions. Where backend integrations usually require the accommodation of every possibility, robotics can isolate outliers that don&rsquo;t pass validation checks or adhere to business rules, breaking the &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; paradigm of automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we build our internal capabilities, the applications of drag-and-drop solutions and robots-as-a-service are enormous. Where connections with third party applications may be limited by permission to make changes or batch processes, robotics can allow us to connect even to external programs through APIs. Our early applications of robotic process automation are also scalable and adaptable to other business areas with little to no development work required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still early in our journey with automation. When we started, we used robotics software that mimics human actions. It basically automated the repetitive task of entering information. It picked up the request in one location and actioned it across multiple systems based on predetermined rules. For example, a staff member changes an address in a certain location and it activates an automated process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we added an app script to improve the user experience of initiating the request and remove the barrier of knowing in advance what form to fill out to activate the process. The third evolution is to layer on machine learning and natural language processing to allow for dynamic interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Robotic automation is what will ultimately bring the capacities of artificial intelligence and machine learning to customers. As the team progressively learns and improves, we are moving from local automation of one-off processes to creating end-to-end solutions. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are moving towards turning natural language inputs into structured data that results in action, rather than an information response. So you say &lsquo;I need to change my address&rsquo; and, instead of written instructions about where to go and what to do, a responding information request actions an automated backend process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re focussed on applying technology in areas that impact customers most. Robotics process automation applied to the right use-cases means better customer experience, and more time for us to hear our customers. Just one of the ways we are working every day to make banking better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you passionate about implementing technology to solve customer problems and improving customer experiences?

At ATB, we are building our capabilities and skill sets to be prepared for a new fast-paced world. And we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from individuals who are set for success with diverse knowledge and skills and the ability to quickly adapt when jobs are automated or required skill sets change.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of &lsquo;unicorn&rsquo; employees. Those magical creatures who seem to be capable of doing anything thrown at them, and doing it well. They are called unicorns because we&rsquo;ve heard stories of them, but often only second-hand&mdash;do they really exist? It is our prediction that these &lsquo;unicorns&rsquo; will become the norm: more of a swiss-army-workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The swiss-army-workforce knows how to acquire the tools required for whatever needs to be accomplished. Later in their careers, swiss-army-knife employees have extremely broad experience and skills&mdash;and they know how to draw on their broad knowledge, even in completely new roles or sectors. These team members are extremely compelling as an employer&mdash;what if you could have three people with the broad skill set of 10, or team members who can quickly acquire the skills to take on a new role. People who can adapt, switch, and be fluid between roles to bring things to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still need the experts who have deep domain expertise&mdash;but equally important are people who are able to switch directions. What about all those jobs that will be replaced with automation? A swiss-army-workforce can be fearless in the face of change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the quest to be ready for the future of banking, we are exploring our innovative mindset, as an organization and at the individual level.

That means we are able to overcome barriers to do things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cracking-compliance-traditional-banking-for-unconventional-business-clients\">breaking into markets outside of traditional banking</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/going-agile-with-agility-the-road-to-organizational-agility\">constantly changing how we work internally.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another huge factor is the team. Innovation in banking won&rsquo;t come from the ideas of one individual&mdash;we&rsquo;re intentional about building a team full of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">diverse thinkers</a>&nbsp;and different backgrounds. People who are bought into the the mission and values of continuous disruption and building a future of banking for the happiness of Albertans. We have great people, and trust in our team. That means that team members have autonomy to explore new ideas and are empowered to be bold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like disruption in the job market from technological change, banking is at high risk of major upheaval. We are striving to figure out our place in that future, which means we have to think beyond what we are and towards what we could become.

We serve it to others - watching, listening, and learning what gets positive responses and how we can make it better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming an innovator follows a similar path - we start by gathering information from thought leaders and experts, followed by narrowing down ideas to key sources of trustworthy information. Then we can synthesize and build on the ideas of others, combining information from various sources and across fields of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking in all of our past experiences and finding connections that others haven&rsquo;t even thought of, we are able to create ideas seemingly from scratch, but in fact they were inspired by the knowledge and history of those who came before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the recipe for innovation?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Be comfortable being uncomfortable - admit you don&rsquo;t know the answer and ask questions.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Gather ideas from broad sources and follow the blueprint until you have the baseline and confidence to generate new ideas.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Put your idea out there and then listen and learn from users or customers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Don&rsquo;t take failure personally - learn something and take a different direction - or apply the learning to your next project.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The best chefs are true artists, taking inspiration from everything they&rsquo;ve seen and tasted - combining ingredients and techniques from different cultures and schools of cooking.

Particularly in banking, there are many competing attributes to rank, including stability of systems and security of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/binaries/content/assets/events/keywords/applications/apn30/pace-layered-applications-research-report.pdf\">Gartner&rsquo;s Pace-Layered Application Strategy&nbsp;</a>is a way to describe how a company organizes around delivering systems with the right balance of velocity and stability.<strong>&nbsp;At ATB, our Enterprise Data Science team is working on applying AI and machine learning to optimize application delivery at each level of the Pace-layer model.&nbsp;</strong>With our internal strengths and valuable external partnerships, we are leveraging AI and machine learning in every aspect of our business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At the systems of record layer,</strong>&nbsp;we are implementing systematic automation to ensure workflow is handled seamlessly and in an integrated fashion. Here, we are applying AI and machine learning by identifying events and applying decision models to rapidly decide and act, with minimal human interaction, while notifying the appropriate stakeholders. This eliminates mundane tasks normally performed by team members allowing them to focus on higher value activities that will have a direct impact on customer happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, using AI to automate some aspects of payment processing, fraud detection, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/from-transaction-to-human-interaction-ux-powered-rapid-account-opening\">customer on-boarding,</a> without changing the underlying structure of systems, means that ATB team members can spend less time behind the computer screen, and more time building relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>At the systems of differentiation laye</strong><strong>r,</strong>&nbsp;we are focused on effectiveness in key strength areas of ATB that differentiate our business from our competitors and disrupt industry. Applying AI and machine learning in areas like customer account management and online experience optimization means greater insights and recommendations to our team members and customers at the right time, in a language that they can understand. We are designing unique online and in-person experiences that are data-driven and real-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In contrast to bimodal models of application delivery, which combine the system of differentiation and innovation layers, the traditional Pace-layer model separates these layers, despite the similar use of agile development practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>For ATB, the systems of innovation layer</strong>&nbsp;is very much separate from the system of differentiation. It is the change engine of our work. It requires research and experimentation to apply and test the application of disruptive technology in our business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We are working internally and externally with the best minds in AI and machine learning to rapidly accelerate proof of concepts against use cases. We have built business units specifically dedicated to innovation with different development timelines and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This is where pace-layering comes in. Our system of innovation teams still need access to core data, through connections to system of record layers, but the development cycle allows for faster testing and deployment of solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can see the world of banking transforming, so we are leveraging our agile size and expertise in AI and machine learning to drive the rapid creation and adoption of AI-based applications across all layers of the organization. Pace-layer application development allows us to apply different development models and priority attributes as required - valuing stability and security in our systems of record applications and valuing velocity, agility, and learning from failure on our innovation teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The future of banking is coming, and AI and machine learning will help ATB be the first to get there.</strong>Looking to become part of this future?

Through these changes, we have relied on some sparky individuals at ATB to help us manage the evolving landscape and ensure that we have a culture of adoption and agile development internally,&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;we scale out. After all, what good is convincing Albertans to adopt new solutions when our own team members aren&rsquo;t feeling it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of our work tends to be behind-the-scenes product development and internal process improvements...things that focus on our own team members. In the early stages of our journey we relied on traditional change management techniques and found that team member adoption was low with more efforts focused on workarounds and avoiding new tools and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because traditional change management techniques were not aligning with our vision of an adoptive culture and an agile environment, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/need-more-spark-in-your-life\">Spark team</a>&nbsp;was assembled with key partnerships across our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams. Rather than traditional task lists and methodology, we&rsquo;ve blown up the typical notions of change management and taken on a lens that focuses on both adoption, and consequently, adaptation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spark team recognized the need to address multiple factors in fostering an adaptive organizational culture where team members rapidly adopt and become users of new solutions. They shifted the internal development process, stood up a dependency dashboard to keep project teams informed, improved user engagement with a methodology for surveying and interviewing, and changed our internal perceptions around failure and project termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This change in perception was crucial for success in fostering an adoptive (and adAptive) culture.&nbsp;</strong>But how does one actually target this shift within a large enterprise? We started by studying some of the most adaptive cultures in the world to uncover the features that they have in common. Here are a few of our top learnings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Adaptive cultures are constantly in flux</strong>, you have to practice to become good at change. Part of ATB&rsquo;s culture is to be comfortable being uncomfortable, this takes daily effort by each team member to step outside their comfort zone. It also takes commitment from our leadership team to be constantly adjusting targets and setting new goals.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Effective change is bottom-up, not top down.&nbsp;</strong>We have a community of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; at ATB, team members who have volunteered to be product testers and early adopters. Our goal is to eventually have the entire organization become igniters</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>It is human nature to act on what you&rsquo;re measured on.&nbsp;</strong>The Spark team celebrates and rewards our team of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; who are instrumental in the deployment process, who act as advocates for a product and support fellow team members in the adoption process.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Widespread change requires momentum.&nbsp;</strong>There will always be an adoption curve, but our goal is to move the entire curve to the left, with greater emphasis on early adopters.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Working towards a culture of adoption, we also need to have the tools to measure success and ensure we put the user at the centre of all our efforts. In addition to user logs, the Spark team has implemented qualitative feedback loops and an internal net promoter score. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another way we are demonstrating our user-centric attitude is by integrating adoption activitie</strong><strong>s.</strong>&nbsp;We are not just measuring adaptiveness, but also taking the lead on things like roadshows, branch visits, and &lsquo;Spark hours&rsquo; to help our vast network of team members embrace what&rsquo;s new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our journey to transform ourselves, and banking, the Spark team is working collaboratively with our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams to create an adaptive group of people who are hungry for new things, rather than frustrated or annoyed with new rollouts. This takes two components: products that are needed, valuable, and based on user input - and people who are accustomed to change and are active in fostering a culture of adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in being part of a team culture with people who are eager to change and adapt?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open opportunities here.</a></strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"fostering-a-culture-of-adoption","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"}],"labs":[]},{"id":59,"title":"Tech debt and digital transformation","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","date":"15.11.2018 22:14","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>In an era where every company is essentially a technology company, no organization can escape the challenge of dealing with technical debt. But the issue is particularly challenging for organizations with large legacy technology systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech debt for technology startups is usually focused on keeping code clean and debugging their software. From the perspective of an organization like ATB, we also have technical debt in terms of the legacy systems that have been bought or built over the years. Not only the technology tools behind our banking systems, but the file sharing, customer relationship management, and team collaboration tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Like keeping the clutter down in your home, it is a constant battle to address technical debt and keep down the clutter of old systems. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of keeping our current systems uncluttered and running smoothly, a huge factor in keeping up with tech debt is maintaining the security and privacy of our customer data and proprietary data. The age of systems often corresponds with the level of vulnerabilities, particularly if those systems are no longer being patched or updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migrated largely from<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/reuse-buy-or-build-new-answers-to-old-questions-in-software-and-tech\"> buy vs build to build vs buy</a> in our digital transformation, a main focus is to get to 100% retirement of old systems. Just like financial debt, the compounding of interest on technical debt is cumulative, and we have to be careful to prioritize how we pay off our technical debt, consolidate into areas with the lowest risk, and make sure we get to 100% retirement of outstanding debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we prioritize paying off our technical debt? Just like how we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optimizing-robotic-process-automation\">optimize</a> across all departments, we ask the questions: &lsquo;is the technology causing disappointed customers?&rsquo; or &lsquo;is it causing mistakes?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first priority is to provide the best banking experience to customers. Further layers of evaluation consider how the tech debt affects the availability, reliability, and security of our systems. Is this tool or technology needed? And what vulnerabilities does it introduce that could cause problems in how we deliver value to customers and team members? What is the minimum we need to do to get this into a supported state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way that we are constantly working to address tech debt is in the adoption of new technologies and tools. There are always great new products and ideas and technology is so accessible that teams can easily adopt new tools. But sometimes it results in even more money, time and investment to offset vulnerability or consolidate systems that can be properly supported. Our Tech Enablement department is the advocate for careful evaluation of new tools, like adopting a new customer relationship management tool. And most importantly, 100% decommissioning of old tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our cloud initiatives at ATB are a great opportunity for teams to leverage technology, giving team members access to the best machine learning tools, and making systems accessible across platforms and from any location. But we don&rsquo;t want to just move all the problems we&rsquo;ve had and all of the tech debt we&rsquo;ve accumulated into the cloud. We want to solve for the underlying problems simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Even within the cloud, we can look at the problem holistically, protect proprietary and customer data and make sure we are not accumulating unnecessary tech debt.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are strategic in how we tackle our tech debt. Just like consumers, we have have to manage our debt carefully, leverage it in places, make sure we are keeping careful track, and paying it down responsibly.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"30.10.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_768_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_500_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"tech-debt-and-digital-transformation","tags":[{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":9,"title":"IT"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"},{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"}],"labs":[]},{"id":52,"title":"Need More Spark in Your Life?","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/052/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:10","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<h2>So do we.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a general rule, a customer should never know more about a business than one of their customer services reps, but sometimes, sh*t happens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more jarring than accidentally telling someone about a new solution their company offers that even they aren&rsquo;t aware of.

In listening to our customers, we&rsquo;re moving from traditional, old-school bank to fintech, and that&rsquo;s left us with a lot of challenges on our hands. We straddle two completely different worlds, with completely different audiences, and we&rsquo;re always striving to honour our foundation while staying timely, efficient, and relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Sparks are deployed&mdash;each into a specific team&mdash;right at the beginning of a project, so that they can understand and maintain focus on the human side by connecting people with the new technologies we roll out on a consistent basis and helping our team members become advocates for transformation. They can also act on behalf of other members of our squads (e.g., learning, communications) so that they can stay focused on their work until a new project is absolutely ready for their input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re both proud and excited to be doing things differently here at ATB. We used to buy our solutions: now we build them. Moving away from a waterfall model and into agile project management has allowed us to get things done in 3-8 weeks instead of the 18 months they used to take. We&rsquo;re working with continuous feedback from our partners, and we&rsquo;re fully prepared to hear when something isn&rsquo;t working. At our size, we can iterate, kill a bad idea fast, and move on&mdash;something our competitors can&rsquo;t do. Sparks are a huge part of this forward motion, because when we make changes, they help those changes reach all 5300 of our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s in it for you? This isn&rsquo;t just a brag about our amazing team. What happens on the inside has an incredible impact on the outside of our company. When we make life smoother and more efficient for our team members, they have more time to return calls and emails, and truly engage with our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our biggest goal in creating the Sparks has been to eliminate information fatigue&mdash;to allow our team members the time and space they need to learn about what&rsquo;s coming down the pipe at ATB, adopt it, experience its value, and share it with you.

All the heads of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their cheque books in tow, ready to settle their scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, as Oil Settlements become electronic, the process acquired new complexities requiring resources, such as reconciling and approvals involving countless humans manually entering in data and double checking contracts all the way along in advance of the big day. Both the energy companies and the banks&mdash;find the process to have become inefficient at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different companies use different internal systems for managing contracts, tracking finances, compliance, and so on. This meant that the entire process of paying out once a month involved people combing over different contracts, manually entering in agreements, and having to decipher one another&#39;s&rsquo; processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now enter blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRANSFORMATION THROUGH TRUST &amp; TRANSPARENCY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since early 2017, ATB and IBM together have built a proof of concept using blockchain that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It no longer matters what internal programs and systems any company in the energy sector uses. It only matters that the agreed upon terms are defined in the blockchain. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including energy companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe the blockchain process will result in 80% of transactions being executed without error and human intervention (as compared to current state). The remaining 20% of transactional volume we anticipate will require &ldquo;human intervention&rdquo;. Even with this conservative estimate, blockchain will enable human capital resources to be optimally re-allocated elsewhere across the value chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to revolutionize such a traditional and large industry such as the oil patch means understanding how that industry&rsquo;s ecosystem works, and involving them in the design and prototyping process. We want the customers to be part of the solutioning so that adoption rates on the other side of the process are high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How ATB addresses solution development and ecosystem adoption is a key part of their journey on all products; as human-centred design is a key internal mandate. As such, working closely with the industry players that experience Oil Settlement Day to ensure they are a key part of the design process is important. This can range from interview to testing to design thinking workshop. People first. Technology next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops provided critical insights into the ecosystem; such as pain points and motivators; culture around priorities and decision making, and more. The conversations shed light on the reality of the vast stakeholders that are engaged in Oil Settlement Day and the need to ensure that a variety of industry players be consulted as part of the blockchain prototype - such as pipeline companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deeper understanding of the ecosystem from the industry&rsquo;s perspective has now guided the steps to expand the needed participants for the MVP development and eventual piloting of the system. Plus, this collaborative process to date means ATB feels confident the Blockchain process it created can provide efficiencies to the energy sector not only in its backyard of Alberta, but across Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BUILDING MORE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past couple of years ATB has been on a journey to build its knowledge and understanding of the capabilities of blockchain, and along the way has managed to begin the development of what it believes will be impactful solutions beyond the oil and gas sector - such as solutions around payment and consumer digital identity. With each, they&rsquo;re engaging ecosystem participants early to help ensure velocity can be maintained as they scale these solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about ATB&rsquo;s approach to innovation, visit &amp; subscribe below!</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"11.12.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"atb-the-value-block-chain-engaging-in-inspired-solution","tags":[{"id":15,"title":"Blockchain"}],"labs":[]},{"id":54,"title":"How to Train Your Robot","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/054/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:12","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<h2>Step one: think like a human</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, our Bot Squad has been busy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly: we&rsquo;ve got a Bot Squad whose work is centred on training software robots to automate banking processes like payments, cash advances, and fee and interest reversals on ATB&rsquo;s Mastercard operations team. The first of those robots is Botson (named by an ATB team member in a contest&mdash;way to go, Myvan!) and we&rsquo;ve just closed in on the end of Phase 1 of training and exploration with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Pepper, Botson is a software robot, which means it doesn&rsquo;t embody a physical robotic form (no labcoat-wearing scientists chasing after a robot with clipboards and stopwatches here!). This type of software is referred to as robotic because it&rsquo;s malleable and can be trained, which is where the Bot Squad comes in.

What we quickly realized is that completing multiple tasks throughout a day takes a lot more than the basic steps. Because every time a new task arises, it can bring with it a unique set of circumstances. So what Botson needs to be trained on are the exceptions to rules, the &quot;what ifs&quot; and the analysis of multiple outcomes that can be required for a single transaction. In other words, the critical thinking skills our human team members possess in droves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this means is that we need the experts on hand to train Botson&mdash;team members who know the work better than anyone else&mdash;who can quickly identify exceptions that may come up and who can call a spade a spade when it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a robot to complete a certain task. When the robot is suited for a task, it needs to be broken down into small, logical pieces; robots work very well in situations where high volume, short task processes need to be completed. They also do well with highly structured data, and with moving data between systems. Where they need some help is in the more human realm of critical analysis and situational decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucky for us, we have an amazing team of humans to do the human work, so our main goal with robots like Botson is to offload repetitive tasks to the bots to free up time for our highly skilled employees to learn more, innovate, and foster relationships with our clients across Alberta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience thus far with Botson has taught us a lot about how to train a robot. Here are our top three takeaways, should you be planning on training a robot of your own in the near future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about today and tomorrow, and the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; - It&rsquo;s not just about solving today&rsquo;s problems in the realm of robot training. It&rsquo;s also about getting critical about today&rsquo;s problem-solving and how it can be improved, and also about looking forward to what may need solving in the future.<br />\r\nPut on your pessimism hat - Just kidding (mostly). When training a robot, you do need to consider all the ways a task or process can go wrong, however, so that you can them how to deal with all possible outcomes. Spread the love - Once you&rsquo;ve got a robot trained to complete certain tasks, it&rsquo;s helpful to think about other contexts those problem-solving skills could work within. Think about this like getting more robotic bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of all of this is that it&rsquo;s just the beginning. We&rsquo;ve got Botson completing a couple types of tasks, but as we train and iterate its processes, we&rsquo;re already envisioning the significant possibilities of this work, and the significant possibilities it will open up for our human teams to explore, grow and excel.

At ATB, we&rsquo;ve been working with facial recognition&mdash;and other biometric tokens&mdash;to explore the various contexts in which they can offer truly effective and efficient solutions for our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any sort of biometric identification, one of the first questions we hear consistently is about whether or not someone could &ldquo;steal&rdquo; your face and use a photo to trick the system and walk away with all the money in your bank account. The quick answer is no, they couldn&rsquo;t, for a few different reasons. A flat image can&rsquo;t just stand in for a real human face, because facial recognition works by projecting a bitmap onto a user&rsquo;s face to detect various ridges and features. It also bounces random light&mdash;invisible to the human eye&mdash;off its subject to detect things like head movement and identify edges on a photo or phone screen that may be present. The only exception is identical twins, so if you&rsquo;ve got a sibling rivalry going on, you&rsquo;re going to want to take extra precautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the technology being virtually impossible to fool, it&rsquo;s important to remember that your biometric tokens are saved on your smartphone or other mobile device&mdash;and not in some random third party database. So in order for someone to steal your money using facial recognition, for example, they would need to have your account info, your device, and your biometrics. So in other words, you&rsquo;re probably much more likely to get eaten by a shark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we did our biometric testing, we found that touch ID provided the most frictionless experience, following by facial recognition and voice ID. 67% of the people we asked said they would use touch ID, with only 14% saying they would use facial recognition, but it will be very interesting to see how these numbers shift and change the more smartphones and devices start to utilize facial recognition and the more it becomes a part of everyday life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already been testing the use of cameras equipped with facial recognition in some our branches, to explore how we could make our customers&rsquo; experiences even smoother. It&rsquo;s just as much work to pull out your debit card as it is to pull out your smartphone to scan your fingerprint&mdash;these cameras could eliminate the need for either. We ultimately would like to be able to recognize customers as they walk into any of our branches so we can have their account info queued up and we&rsquo;re ready to help the moment they approach our desk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also be supporting facial recognition on our mobile banking app, which, surprisingly, is an incredibly quick and easy system to integrate. On our end, it&rsquo;s essentially a flip of a switch before we&rsquo;re ready to accept facial recognition. The actual wait, of course, will be for all smartphones to integrate facial recognition technology. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll soon be ready for anyone already using it. We&rsquo;re really excited to see what adoption rates and variety of uses will be like moving forward, and we&rsquo;re ready to support, learn, and iterate our own technologies and processes to develop the best solutions possible to make ATB customers&rsquo; lives better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for top talent to work on innovative projects just like this one.

It can also be hard to share information on the internet if you can&rsquo;t trust where it&rsquo;s going to end up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We told you a little bit about blockchain technology and the potential for<a href=\"http://ttps://atbalphabeta.com/articles/71\">&nbsp;identity records,</a> but how can people and organizations actually start using these innovations in real life? It starts with a network, and ATB has been exploring one such network as the first Canadian steward of Sovrin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin is a blockchain network that works by acting as the &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; between facts&mdash;they accept facts about people or places, as well as the verification from another authorized party that those facts are true and trustworthy. For example, in the future, when we all have digital identity records, you could add your new driver&rsquo;s license to your records through Sovrin, and the Government of Alberta could verify that it is, in fact, a real and valid license. From there, you could use your identity record anywhere you need to present ID with the simple scan of a QR code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the fact that this process would be highly efficient and completely trustworthy, it also adds a new level of security to our lives. Consider the number of times you&rsquo;ve had to present your ID just to prove that you&rsquo;re over 18. The person verifying your age, in the process of doing so, has also had access to your full date of birth, your address, your height and weight, etc. Using an identity record would allow a third party to scan a QR code and know&mdash;without doubt&mdash;that you are over 18, without learning anything else about you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refreshing, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why have we become a steward of Sovrin, and what does that actually mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin was founded by Evernym, who quickly realized that in order to truly operate a network of trust, Sovrin needed to be a non-profit organization, separate from any for-profit company. As a foundation with a diverse board of trustees, Sovrin can and does now exist and function without its founding company, and all servers and software required to run the network are provided by stewards for no fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud to be the first Canadian steward, and it&rsquo;s our goal to be the first bank in North America to offer our customers digital identity records. Of course, there are many challenges associated with that goal. As leaders in innovation, ATB gets involved in these sorts of explorations very early on. Sovrin may not be the end all, be all solution, but it&rsquo;s a strong solution and it&rsquo;s allowing us to move forward, which is the direction we&rsquo;re always looking to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being innovators often also presents the challenge of working in a space without a lot of groundwork or foundation. How do we introduce digital identity records to the mass market? How do we ensure our customers feel comfortable and eager to adopt them? And how to we encourage and foster other companies and organizations to start working with digital wallets and a blockchain network? We&rsquo;ve taken all of these questions and thrown them into our sandbox environment, where we&rsquo;re doing a lot of internal testing. We expect this project to go through countless iterations throughout 2018 so that we can make sure the many complexities of the system are dealt with and fully understood before we roll it out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey.

We&rsquo;re also eagerly sharing new tools and technologies with ATB customers through MVP launches, beta tests, and new business lines. And, lucky for us, many of our customers just can&rsquo;t get enough!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core changes in how we do business differently came from a shift in our internal mindset. Adopting a customer obsession and talking to customers about their needs and wants and how they currently use banking tools. For financial institutions, this is a different way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than just a few new rules, we&rsquo;re now playing a fundamentally different game. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our customer obsession, we gathered the team of innovative thinkers and the technology stack to enable us to design and prototype tools to meet those customer needs. Our shift to the cloud and integration of APIs are one of the changes that has allowed us to bring new products to customers with speed and agility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are building for customer needs, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that change isn&rsquo;t hard. We know we have to work constantly to create a state of comfort for our customers and to maintain confidence in our systems and the changes that we make. That means allowing customers to consume just enough to understand. Giving customers control over their experience and assuring them that what they do everyday will still work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, updating a customer tool or the look and feel of an online business banking platform would have had a launch date, with communication plans for educating team members and customers that a new tool was launching. Inevitably, on launch day, customers still feel like it is a change that is done<em> *to* </em>them, and not *<em>for* </em>them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are turning that process around and putting value first. What are people actually doing and how can we make small improvements that will make their life better? By sharing our MVP with groups of customers early and iterating along the path, we actually get to the end stage with a better outcome and also with more value for customers over all. We fix problems when they are at a smaller scale, with 100 or 1,000 users instead of a full launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because online banking tools are key in managing money, we need to make sure customers involved in this journey are confident that we aren&rsquo;t negatively disrupting their process for changes that we can&rsquo;t bring to life rapidly. A key to keeping the confidence of customers in the early testing phase is to give them confidence that it is secure and stable, that they can&rsquo;t break anything, do anything accidentally, or &lsquo;make a mistake.&rsquo; Importantly, the tools we&rsquo;re testing must also have value for them to try it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms - we start off at a very small scale. Our first testers are generally customers who have expressed a specific need. And the testing happens with live systems, not demos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is no alternative to a real experience for a customer with their live account information and actually satisfying a need or completing a task.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We empower our customer to decide what experience they will have. Importantly, they have the option to go back to the old experience. There is no down side for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small steps, user-centred design, and putting customers in charge of their own experience; that is how we are building a base of ATB customers who are willing to change and grow along with us. Avid supporters and enthusiastic beta users. Customers with the same adoption mindset as ATB team members. We may be playing a new game, but our teamwork is stronger than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you an ATB customer interested in beta testing new products?

Although more than 60 thousand people work in the arts and cultural sectors of Alberta (generating over five billion dollars a year), the industry is competitive, cash flows erratic and dreams underfunded. Plus, that &ldquo;break the mould&rdquo; approach to creativity isn&rsquo;t always an understood mindset when it comes to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than ask artists to conform to a bank&rsquo;s view of an ideal customer, banking needs to catch up, step up, and meet the unique needs of artists‒for the greater good of all Albertans. Which is exactly why we&rsquo;re taking a fresh artists-first approach to banking with the ATB Branch for Arts and Culture (or, &quot;The Branch&quot;), launching in Calgary and Edmonton late November.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch will be unlike any other location we&rsquo;ve opened. In fact, you could say we&rsquo;re focused on making it as un-banky as possible&mdash;c&rsquo;mon, not all of us at ATB are &quot;left-brained&quot;. The Branch for Arts and Culture is built by artists (that happen to be expert bankers), for artists. The team working at The Branch are artists themselves, who intimately understand what it&rsquo;s like to live and work creatively, and who will be focused on offering a range of solutions to clients with a range of not-so-typical income streams. Beyond providing customized financial services, The Branch hints at a future as an arts venue, morphing into anything from a concert site to a gallery space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch staff has been talking and listening to artists and creatives to truly understand how we can provide as much support as possible. From workshops for those who need more guidance in their grant applications to a variety of different lending models to connecting our customers with Blue Cross, we know that financial confidence and planning is not as prominent in the arts world as it is in others, and we&rsquo;re on our way to changing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that note, our left brains are already at work helping artists access ATB&rsquo;s alternative financing solutions, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atbboostr.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB BoostR</a>. Our crowdfunding platform allows the village to get directly involved in the journey of a local artist, and also, as a great side benefit, helps us develop new lending and credit models that reflect the lives of creatives. Imagine lending models that include a wider view of credit indicators and take creativity, community and commitment into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that creative-preneurs are important beyond their creative sphere. They&rsquo;re innovators. They help bring about significant economic diversification and can spark big changes to communities by fostering and building a pool of top talent, which leads to catching the eye of top employers, new HQs moving in, and a whole heck of a lot of growth. For us, it&rsquo;s also about putting our money where our mouth is: when we say we&rsquo;re on a mission to transform banking and help all types of entrepreneurs amplify their business, we mean it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCheck out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atb.com/thebranch\" target=\"_blank\">www.atb.com/thebranch</a>&nbsp;for more details.

Banks in other countries are further along.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A look at some of the deployments in three of them &mdash; Israel, Canada and Hong Kong &mdash; could offer ideas and inspiration for those in the early stages, as well as insight into what is working and what is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few takeaways: Bots are not just for millennials, document scanning can be the hardest part, and people are more comfortable asking questions of bots than they are of humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Israel</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank Leumi officially launched the AI-powered, mobile-only bank Pepper in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence lets Pepper provide what CEO Lilach Bar-David calls &ldquo;contextual intelligence.&rdquo; The AI engine analyzes customers&rsquo; transactions, what they are clicking on, how long they stay on specific data elements, and other data points to determine what should appear in each customer&rsquo;s app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes real-time, daily, weekly and monthly spending alerts and customized content including news articles and consumer tips based on the AI engine&rsquo;s growing understanding of what the customer does, wants and responds well to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It takes time &mdash; the more you transact with us, the more we know about you and the more we leverage that data to give you personalized banking,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;So my Pepper and yours won&rsquo;t look the same because the feed will be based on our personal behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper warns customers of potential problems &mdash; for example, if a customer continues to spend at his or her current rate, that customer will have a negative checking account balance by the end of the month. It might also tell the customer it&rsquo;s OK to draw from savings to avoid that negative balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper will eventually be three apps that can be used alone or together, linked with a single sign-on. The Pepper banking app provides access to checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and loans. Pepper Pay, launched in February, allows person-to-person payments. And an investment app is due to launch by early next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, a few hundred thousand users have downloaded the Pepper banking and Pepper Pay apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to help customers better manage their money. The bank conducted several surveys of the &ldquo;global millennials&rdquo; it targets with Pepper and found they were less concerned about fees because they don&rsquo;t know how much they pay anyway, but struggled with lack of knowledge about banking in general and how to develop good personal finance habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early adopters are not who Bank Leumi thought they would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were under the assumption that only millennials would get on board Pepper, but actually, more than half its users are consumers aged 35 and above,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;It makes me think we&rsquo;re reaching people with millennials&rsquo; state of mind more than an age.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is developing 24/7 human customer service for all three apps over voice, video and chat. When the customer starts a call or chat, agents will know who the customer is and what they have been doing; the AI engine will try to predict their questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, customers really like the video chat; they use it to help them navigate the eight-minute sign-up process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest part of onboarding, Bar-David said, has been having the app read information from the ID documents correctly in Hebrew. The workaround is to let people take pictures of their IDs and then type in the details from their phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because design is important &mdash; &ldquo;When they join a bank that&rsquo;s only mobile, consumers compare you to Facebook, Google; the expectations are sky high,&rdquo; Bar-David said &mdash; the bank hired 150 employees, many from tech startups, to create the mobile apps. It worked with the strategy design firm Designit on the apps&rsquo; look and feel, including a custom-made font. The core is Temenos&rsquo; software, selected for its affordability so Bank Leumi can pass those lower costs on to customers, Bar-David said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper is being given time before it is required to produce a return on an investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;On the one hand, it&rsquo;s a strategic move for Leumi,&rdquo; Bar-David explained. &ldquo;They did it because they believe disruption is needed and consumers expect a dramatically better experience in the banking industry. On the other hand, we didn&rsquo;t build a bank for fun. It has to be in the end a bank that&rsquo;s profitable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Canada, RBC launched a Personetics-based virtual assistant including financial guidance and automated savings features in September. TD Bank embedded an AI chatbot that uses Kasisto&rsquo;s Kai software in its mobile banking app in early October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another large Canadian regional bank, ATB Financial, launched an AI virtual assistant for Facebook Messenger using Finn.ai&rsquo;s technology in late October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comfort factor</strong><br />\r\nPeople are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being, says Wellington Holbrook of ATB Financial in Canada. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook he says.<br />\r\nThough other banks, including Wells Fargo, Citi and TD Ameritrade, have Facebook Messenger bots, ATB says it is the first in the world to offer full-featured banking through Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always thinking of new ways to creatively compete with much larger competitors: How do we bring better service to our customers, how do we compete on scale?&rdquo; said Wellington Holbrook, chief transformation officer at the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For financial institutions like ours, [a virtual assistant is] a bit of an evening of the playing field,&rdquo; Holbrook said. &ldquo;When you consider the complexity of bringing a lot of different services to our customers through traditional channels, it&rsquo;s very people intensive, very cost intensive, and we&rsquo;re at a disadvantage in terms of our relative size. The virtual assistant is an equalizer for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year ago, Jake Tyler, CEO of Finn.ai, and his team approached Holbrook to suggest ways the bank could provide more modern experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The virtual assistant creates a departure from the traditional ways of thinking about banking, to a much more modern way of thinking that has more in common with the way you interact with other types of organizations or your peer groups as a consumer,&rdquo; Tyler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This increasingly means providing banking services through third-party platforms like Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finn.ai, Tyler said, lets people do about 80% of their banking activities in a Facebook Messenger bot. Customers can pay bills, pay friends and transfer money between accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time that full featured functionality has been available&quot; within Facebook Messenger, Tyler said. &ldquo;We thought it was important to do core banking activity for customers as the foundation for an assistant that will be useful to them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a spending insight feature of which customers can ask questions like, &ldquo;What did I spend at Starbucks?&rdquo; or &ldquo;When is my Mastercard bill due?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB and Finn.ai are working to make the bot more helpful, so beyond telling customers when their bills are due, the bot might make sure they have enough money in their accounts to pay them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any question the bot cannot answer gets passed to human agents at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In testing the virtual assistant, Holbrook observed the same thing Darrius Jones has noticed in USAA&rsquo;s use of Clinc&rsquo;s AI-based Amazon Alexa Skill: People are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holbrook&rsquo;s biggest aspiration for the bot is to make it easier for customers to bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The banking industry has been focused for a long time on driving efficiencies, making banking work better for us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the revolution of smart devices, we haven&rsquo;t kept up with making experiences better for our customers. We see this as the beginning of ways we&rsquo;re going to use tech to help customers make more out of their time, and create more happiness in their lives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Hong Kong</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest noteworthy announcement of a customer-facing AI implementation is Standard Chartered Bank, which is based in London but has a presence in 68 countries. In mid-November, the company said it planned to deploy a chatbot on its online and mobile banking platforms using Kasisto&#39;s conversational artificial intelligence platform, KAI Banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chatbot will help clients manage money, make payments and analyze their spending via natural conversations in English and other languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to take the bot live first in Hong Kong next year in English (subject to regulatory approval), then gradually deploy worldwide in multiple languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is not ready to talk about the technology yet, but Zor Gorelov, Kasisto&#39;s CEO, said his company is teaching KAI Banking about Hong Kong regulatory rules and banking practices, as well as about Standard Chartered products to prepare for the rollout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is also teaching the software to speak &ldquo;Chinglish&rdquo; in text and voice communications: Sometimes people will start a sentence in one language and finish it in another, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai already understands much of the banking terminology used in different parts of the world, Gorelov said. For instance, it knows that &ldquo;current account,&rdquo; &ldquo;CA&rdquo; and &ldquo;checking account&rdquo; all mean the same thing. It knows that &ldquo;FD,&rdquo; &ldquo;fixed deposit&rdquo; and &ldquo;certificate of deposit&rdquo; are different ways of describing the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re learning everyday here at ATB and looking for insights anywhere we can.

We must evaluate risk and analyze how suitable a process is for automation - this requires human judgement, reasoning, and compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But yet, there are plenty of processes that are ripe for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At ATB, we&rsquo;re not afraid of working alongside automation, because we know how much value our (human) team members provide to each other and to customers. Our team members offer, through judgment, the ability to listen and engage - things our bots or any AI we implement just can&rsquo;t provide. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we evaluate and implement intelligent process automation, we use a customer focussed lens to identify and prioritize projects. By focusing on customers, we&rsquo;ve identified over 50 processes to tackle through a combination of streamlining and end-to-end intelligent automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal: to disrupt the customer experience and reduce manual work required by team members, allowing them to focus on the value of human interaction (and eliminating potential for common human faults, such as typos or inconsistencies in data entry). By leaning into intelligent process automation technology, we get to continually live up to our tagline &ldquo;Banking Made Simple.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation means that we can: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Reduce risk</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Think of a simple form of automation: automatic vehicle lights. For decades, a human had to turn on the lights when it got dark. Automation removes the human factor of this clear binary decision. When the sensor detects dim light, a switch flips and the headlights turn on - no possibility for human error, and reduced risk of accidents due to impaired visibility on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Similarly, processes like account suspension based on fraudulent activity benefit greatly from the combination of high-powered real-time data monitoring. Automation then carries out tasks between different internal systems based on data inputs and structured rules.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Even updating customer information such as addresses can be a tedious task because team members must go into numerous different systems depending on the products that the customer has with ATB. Process automation, combined with data validation on the inputs, eliminates the risk of errors and reduces overall manual work for our team members so they can work on what they do best.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Work smarter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As a human race, we&rsquo;ve levelled up in terms of our intelligence and achievements. We&rsquo;ve historically used tools to augment our abilities, and now computing power and technology have put information at our fingertips. We&rsquo;ve moved from needing to know <em>how to do</em> math to needing to know <em>how to use</em> a calculator to input your problem, for example. Now, we are taking this one step further and moving into a stage where a computer can actually identify both the problem and the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>ATB is an organization that offers a diverse set of products and services. Therefore, we have a lot of systems and processes in place that don&rsquo;t always talk to each other. What robotic process automation allows us to do is create value for our customers by enabling the connection of all of these processes. Problem &rarr; Solution.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Save money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Working more efficiently is always a key priority in business. Anywhere that we can streamline process and improve how we work provides value to our customers and stakeholders. Thus, robotic process automation allows us to streamline process without investing in new systems and means we can service our clients faster.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>We are also living in an interesting time where technology has become more democratized. Computing power is not only increasing at an exponential rate. That power is also becoming accessible at a much lower price point. Improvements to hardware and the rise of cloud computing make it possible for any organization to employ better technology at a lower investment than ever before.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Provide more value</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much opportunity to augment human knowledge and decision-making by leveraging technology in banking. We can be smarter about giving advice to customers, and about fulfilling customer requests. We can move information faster and more seamlessly. Rather than aiming for 100% automated processes, we are working toward 100% value-added work from our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining the power of technology and the skills of our team members enables us to enhance the ATB experience. Whether you prefer to find answers to your banking questions on your own or by speaking with one of our team members, process automation and technologies such as artificial intelligence allow us to deliver a great customer experience every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to robotics software, we leverage enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing to optimize our processes end-to-end. AI can help us better capture what the customer needs (but not feel like they are interacting with a robot), and from there, robotic process automation can execute the process to fulfill their request. Eventually, machine learning and using robots as a service will allow us to build on these solutions and integrate more of our core processes or third-party applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s so magical about process automation is its ability to drastically change the customer experience without huge investment in back-end systems. We&rsquo;re not afraid of a future where error-prone repetitive tasks are handled by robots and our human team members can spend their time providing value to ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscribe below or join the team at <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">careers.atbalphabeta.com</a>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"28.11.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/064/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/064/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"robots-aren-t-taking-our-jobs-how-robotic-process-automation-helps-improve-customer-service","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":5,"title":"Robotics"},{"id":6,"title":"Automation"},{"id":4,"title":"AI"}],"labs":[]},{"id":62,"title":"From Academia to AI - the pivot.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/062/article_image.jpg","date":"15.11.2018 22:19","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":true,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p><strong>Many academics are finding new career paths in applying theoretical expertise to the exploding field of AI and machine learning. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we sat down with Mark Sebestyen, a mathematician turned ATB data scientist to ask about what short advice he has for scientists who want to make the transition to the applied world of ML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For researchers with advanced degrees in mathematics, physics, statistics, and computer engineering, moving from theoretical and research applications to the world outside academia opens a world of beauty and passion as theoretical knowledge finds valuable applications in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is huge value in having AI and machine learning teams made up of members from enormously diverse backgrounds. It is one thing to know the algorithm or to apply a black box solution, but you need the team to have people who really understand how the algorithm works, and people who have deep user understanding.

You walk into your neighbourhood ATB where you&rsquo;re greeted by Pepper the robot. She scans your fingerprint and you tell her you&rsquo;re ready to get your first mortgage. She directs you to a customer experience rep whose computer&mdash;based on your fingerprint and vocal recognition&mdash;has already pulled up your identity record, complete with a recent photo, address, credit history and biometric tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting you up with your mortgage is quick and frictionless&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need for long approval processes and credit checks. This identity record is stamped with the date it was created, and also contains a list of notes and additions you&rsquo;ve made to it since birth. Everywhere you go, you&rsquo;re able to securely update this identity record, and every time you do, your new information is instantly passed on to the organizations you&rsquo;ve authorized to see it. Your identity, belongs to you, and only you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t some lofty dream of the year 3000. It&rsquo;s a dream we have of the not-so-distant future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with blockchain as the technological backbone to Bitcoin. The name is self-explanatory once you understand how the technology works. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin blockchain groups all transactions that have taken place during that time frame, puts them through an algorithm, and adds that group&mdash;or block&mdash;to a chain of other transaction blocks. Each block in the chain refers to the previous block, which refers to the previous block, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes blockchain technology so appealing is its level of security. Blockchain&rsquo;s algorithms are incredibly difficult to hack, and with Bitcoin you only have a 10-minute window in which to try. After that point, a new block of transactions is created and you can&rsquo;t change a single block without the waterfall effect of the system being completely broken down. You would have to communicate your hacked block changes to every single computer in the Bitcoin network. With a distributed leger system in place (i.e., copies of transactions existing on thousands of computers), it would be essentially impossible to communicate that quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, in many ways, blockchain systems like the one developed for Bitcoin may seem like the last place banks would want to get involved, because the system itself diminishes the need for an intermediary (i.e., a bank) to be present for security reasons. The trust required to complete a transaction securely is built into the system&mdash;the system&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the trust provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we&rsquo;ve found in blockchain systems, however, is not a fear of our own demise, but significant opportunities to make our customers&rsquo; lives better in so many ways, starting with banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of last year, we sent money from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BMxnHQGy4\" target=\"_blank\">Canada to Germany using a blockchain system</a>&nbsp;called Ripple. Typically, a transaction like this would take a few hours to complete. This one took eight seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many Albertans have family around the world. And sending money home can be a huge risk. Cost and safety are major issues. Ripple&mdash;or a future system similar to it &mdash;could negate these issues by depositing funds directly into a bank or cell phone account in seconds. No need to coordinate time zones for phone calls and ID verification. No need for your loved ones to anxiously carry cash home. Just an easy few seconds and a definite boost of happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not stopping at international transactions. We want to explore the possibility of creating secure digital identities that individuals have complete control over in a highly secure system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&rsquo;re certainly not ready to set up your identity record tomorrow, we&rsquo;re fully prepared to figure out how we can create this transformative experience for our customers and lead the way on what we consider one of the most exciting and impactful uses of the blockchain system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think of all the places your identity is currently stored. Rather than 10-20 different organizations having their own version of your identity, you could go through life with one consistent record, that you completely control, granting other parties access to it when necessary&mdash;to open a bank account, get a car loan or be approved for your first mortgage.&nbsp;</strong>This is the future ATB is exploring, with the help of blockchain technology. And our starting point is, of course, making banking work for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to be part of a team intentionally building for the future?

And then again when you return from lunch. And a coffee break. And when you need to zip out and grab something for dinner.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are you exhausted just thinking about it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The best kind of architecture is that which provides you with fewer hurdles to overcome in order to get to your destination, plus having a solid foundation you can build upon in the future. The result: agility, responsiveness and speed, without having to rethink the foundation each and every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been running ATB using an overly complex and resource-intensive Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) layer for a long time. That means that if we make changes to one element in our banking system, it impacts a significant number of other elements - forcing us to basically do an obstacle course through our own architecture. Think of it this way - if a service calls for XYZ, our ESB can provide ABC, but it has to hop over D-K and crawl under M-R before it can final go straight fromXYZ. This makes it complex to work with, not only for us, but for any third parties who require access to our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, our technological architecture has been slowing us down, so it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve teamed up with the most experienced mobile technologies team in the market: IBM. Together, we&rsquo;ve built a digital lab where we&rsquo;re working on a very exciting new architecture for ATB. There are no lab coats here. Just some of the greatest minds from both IBM and ATB, creating a system that could entirely change the way we provide banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest changes we&rsquo;re working towards is our project approach. We&rsquo;re leaving the waterfall approach to system architecture behind and focusing on faster technologies and methodologies. Rather than making a change to the system and having to wait to see if it&rsquo;ll have a negative impact on the whole system, we can work very quickly&mdash;think deploying a new feature in one month instead of eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if that feature doesn&rsquo;t work as planned? The system works both ways: we can fail fast and fix it fast, allowing ATB to be incredibly adaptable in a world where technologies are constantly changing. Does that sound like the type of place where you can succeed? Check out our<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;open positions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This adaptability isn&rsquo;t due only to ditching the waterfalls&mdash;we&rsquo;re taking a leap far ahead of other banks and moving to an agnostic and highly scalable system. One which allows us to adopt and adapt third-party APIs, quickly bringing them to our customers through strategic partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can look forward to our first release with this approach&mdash;for mobile&mdash;around the end of the year. But remember, this is an ongoing journey. Internally, we&rsquo;re looking at new releases to existing platforms every couple weeks, so there&rsquo;s lots more to come. What we&rsquo;re hoping though, is that the technology gets so good it disappears. So...in all likelihood, you may not notice our back of house changes because things work as expected. And that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x1194\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"06.12.2017","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"don-t-go-chasing-waterfalls","tags":[{"id":16,"title":"Data"},{"id":6,"title":"Automation"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"}],"labs":[]},{"id":61,"title":"Transforming how we work: our journey to the cloud","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/061/article_image.jpg","date":"15.11.2018 22:18","facets":["progress","business"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;ve been sharing the story of our G Suite adoption far and wide. And one of the questions we get often is &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t it disruptive?&rsquo; - the answer is yes, and that&rsquo;s what we were going for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As technology makes leaps forward, the next generation of consumers, and workers will be almost immune to OS updates and new product launches. Similarly, organizations large and small don&rsquo;t need to adopt latest and greatest technology, they need to learn to continually embrace change and disrupt themselves. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our transition to G Suite, we did not take the perspective of technology change or upgrade, but rather looked at it as an opportunity to look at how and why we do things, and really reimagine how we work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was more than simply moving files to the cloud, or copying formulas from an old spreadsheet to a Google Sheet, we approached the transition to G Suite as an opportunity to question everything about how we work. Asking &lsquo;does this provide value to customers? And &lsquo;how might we do this better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits of our transformation are much more than simply new tools, it is about a new mindset. For example, in our old mindset, team members would work on a document until completion before sending for comments, receiving feedback and then compiling. In our new mindset, we have adopted to a &nbsp;&lsquo;co-authoring&rsquo; approach where docs are shared from the outset, often before they are &lsquo;ready.&rsquo; This results in deeper and faster collaboration, but it is also an example of our changed perspective on genuine collaboration and vulnerability as individuals and as an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey to the cloud has been exciting and rewarding, so we want to share some of the highlights that enabled us to transform the way we work on our mission to empower team members to reimagine banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let the story guide you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.atb.com/about/Pages/our-story.aspx\">ATB story</a> is a guiding narrative for everything we do. Ultimately we want to create customer happiness. On our path to get there, we have the specific intention to make time richer. A goal that permeates every level of the organization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo when our G Suite transition team was evaluating how much email history to migrate to the cloud, the ultimate answer came down to valuing the time of our team members. Rather than encouraging staff to do a &lsquo;spring cleaning&rsquo; of their email, or asking them to manage with only 30 or 45 days of their email history during the transition, we made the choice to migrate our entire email history. When it came down to &lsquo;making their time richer,&rsquo; the decision was a no-brainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Forget &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizational change often comes with a scheduled &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; and a project plan that works backwards from that, with milestones and communication to staff members to keep them informed and to prime them for the big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did away with that entirely and essentially rolled out the G Suite to waves of early adopters. <strong>In the end, we had nearly 15% of the company as early adopters and teams were begging to have the full roll out so that the tools were available to all members. When &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; finally came, it was pretty much a non-event.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The psychological safety that came from having &lsquo;optional&rsquo; adoption, experts and gurus, and building excitement meant that they didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a change being inflicted on them when the time came. There was also no expectations that team members would become experts day one. Rather, as the organization moved through the transition, team members would grow to adopt and master the tools available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Self-select the leaders</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many organization, leadership would select team members to be seconded to special transformational projects. The G Suite launch team said no-way to that and instead we opted for self-selection, letting team members from across the organization apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was having a 50 person team known as the G Evangelists that were interested, passionate, and all-in to lead the charge. It also resulted in enormous diversity, pulling in everyone from branch team members from rural locations to managing directors from head office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It was extremely valuable to bring in the different perspectives of all teams who would be affected by the change and it was especially important that team members &lsquo;checked their titles at the door&rsquo; meaning that all team members were heard and valued for their diverse perspectives. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The self-selection process also was a great professional development opportunity for team members who might not otherwise have been exposed to the challenge. More than half of the G Suite adoption team ended up in different parts of the organization after being exposed to the change and showing their great skills and leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get executive on board </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem to make sense to leave the transition of the executive team to the end, making sure that all the kinks are worked out and that all of their staff are already on the new system. We took a bit of a different approach, giving &lsquo;white-glove&rsquo; service to our executives and their teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a real explosion point for our adoption, executives begging for more team members to be added to the adoption team, as they started seeing immense value in the tools. G+ communities, live video broadcasts, and competitions gave our staff access to executive team members like they had never had before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let team members guide themselves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you politely tell someone to &lsquo;Google it themselves?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of multi-hour training session and a dedicated help-desk, we wanted to enable peer-to-peer learning and let the organization support itself. We used G Suite tools and ingenuity to connect team members to support each other. For example, we had G Guides who acted as roaming support, looking for team members who might need help and for team members who couldn&#39;t find a G guide, we had physical signs at the desks of G Whizzes - indicating team members near you in the office who might have answers to your questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also saw enormous uptake of G+ communities - threads like &ldquo;Hey, did you know&rdquo; where people shared exciting features or capabilities that they discovered. And &ldquo;How do I&hellip;&rdquo; chats where team members can troubleshoot for each other, share expertise, and alleviate the need for dedicated experts and support teams. A storyteller collective also allowed team members to share stories of success and transformation to continue to excite and inspire others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of spending time doing in-person training sessions, we ran labs, inspired by the <a href=\"https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage\">Google Garage</a>, where, instead of technical lessons, we helped teams completely reimagine how they do their work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re fully on G Suite collaborating like rock-stars but, even more importantly, we&rsquo;re more ready than ever as individuals and an organization to adapt to changes that we know are coming our way. Ready to react, and not afraid to disrupt ourselves. Come along with us as we explore the future of banking and create happiness for Albertans.

No more &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; someone into defined channels (like bank branches, websites, and mobile apps). We&rsquo;re moving toward a new breed of banking that is conveniently intertwined with one&rsquo;s day-to-day life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In partnership with Finn.ai, we&rsquo;re thrilled to be the first bank in Canada to be working toward launching a banking chatbot. When it&rsquo;s live, you&rsquo;ll be able to text the chatbot through Facebook Messenger, asking it to perform different types of transactions. From&nbsp;<em>Interac</em>&nbsp;e-Transfers<em>,&nbsp;</em>to bill payments, and viewing transaction histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to integrate the chatbot with the Facebook Messenger platform because, so far, it&rsquo;s one of the only text-based platforms that&rsquo;s allowing outside bot APIs to develop new technology. Luckily it&rsquo;s a platform lots of people are comfortable using, and one of the most used phone apps driving a significant amount of user behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is made possible through a specific form of AI called Natural Language Processing. It allows the chatbot to learn from its own mistakes, bettering its ability to understand customer requests and respond accordingly over time. It&rsquo;s not perfect (yet), but it does provide a new way to bank where, when and how you want, and we&rsquo;re pretty optimistic about the chatbot&rsquo;s learning capacity when it comes to our long term project goals. We believe transactional capabilities are just table stakes for the much wider applications of a true Virtual Banking Assistant. The future of this will be much more like the movie&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;and much less like having a bank teller in your pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chatbots are new to banking, but not to people. Companies like Domino&rsquo;s have built chatbots you can text to order pizza. Pizza is pretty innocuous, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a big deal if the fact that you order pizza twice a week &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; to everyone you know. It&rsquo;s a bigger deal if it&rsquo;s your bank account info becomes public. So even though we&rsquo;re the first to integrate a banking chatbot into Facebook, we want to make sure we&rsquo;re refining toward a seamless and safe experience for users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re iterating our authentication module daily, and pairing technology with education. We&rsquo;ll focus on sharing best practices with users around device and information protection because you can never be too safe. The biggest risk happens when money moves out of an account&mdash;for that reason, we&rsquo;ve employed &ldquo;friendly money movement&rdquo; for our chatbot banking services, which restricts customers to transactions involving accounts that have already been set up and approved for the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Facebook Messenger is our first step, it&rsquo;s certainly not the only one. Beyond this social media chatbot, we&rsquo;re already exploring voice activation so that we can move into accessing the bot through systems like Siri, Google Home and Alexa. These interactions will be very different from their on-screen counterparts, but will still require our bot to learn the multiple ways basic questions can be asked (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my account balance?&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;How much money do I have?&rdquo;), among many other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a highly iterative process&mdash;we&rsquo;re always listening for feedback from our early adopters and customers to prioritize/implement new features and functionalities regularly. And we&rsquo;re proud to be partnering with amazing fintechs, like Finn.ai,&nbsp; to pave the way when it comes to offering you the ease of banking services no matter where you&rsquo;re spending your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanting to be part of innovative projects that disrupt the banking industry.

It&rsquo;s why one of our main focal points has always and will always be customer education and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID login on all of our apps, and we use retinal ID to serve the Boyle Street community in Edmonton, many of whom are homeless and can&rsquo;t get a bank account without traditional ID (more on this in September!).

Unlike your thumbprint or retinas, there&rsquo;s a lot that can interfere with voice recognition (street noise, laryngitis, etc.), and your face shape and appearance could change drastically from year to year depending on how life is treating you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our greatest barrier, however, is the imagination, and not technology. The fears surrounding biometrics have been interesting, to say the least. Many fear having their faces and fingerprints stolen&mdash;by way of a sharp cleaver to the wrist. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that we&rsquo;re not storing a photo gallery of facial scans and thumbprints. In fact, there are no images at all&mdash;just digital translations of your face, voice, and fingerprints on a database. Long story short, it&rsquo;d be much easier for someone to save your profile photo and throw it into Face Swap than hack our system. While possible, it would require next level skills and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As strong as biometrics are, two-factor authentication would always be in play: your device&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>a biometric token. Never&nbsp;<em>either or</em>. And despite increased security, there&rsquo;s no increased friction. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your phone. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your fingerprints. You do the math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond transporting you into your favourite sci-fi film, biometrics could continue to make significant social strides, especially when it comes to the underbanked: those who may not have the standard tools or resources required for traditional banking (things like ID or a stable mailing address). As we&rsquo;re learning through our work with Boyle Street, using biometric identification to help individuals secure their funds despite not having access to other basic services is potentially a game changer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about technology for technology&rsquo;s sake.

Supporting entrepreneurs &nbsp;is something we&rsquo;re really passionate about at ATB, from building entrepreneur centres, to crowdfunding/crowdlending platforms and an accelerator program. Now we&rsquo;re working on something that&rsquo;ll allow entrepreneurs in Alberta to access quality talent from their computer or mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, we launched a pilot of ATB Gigs: a way to connect Alberta business owners with people who can help them get stuff done. If it sounds really simple, that&rsquo;s because it is. We want entrepreneurs to be focused on the important stuff, and in order to do that, we know there&rsquo;s a lot of other work that has to come off their plates. But hiring a full-time employee isn&rsquo;t always the answer. Beyond the fact that paying another full salary may be out of reach, chances are entrepreneurs need help in a lot of different branches of their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s data entry, copywriting, event planning, emails, phone calls or folding promotional t-shirts for their next charity event, entrepreneurs can log into ATB Gigs, create a gig, and wait for the applications to pour in. For now, we&rsquo;ve got a pool of students who have gone through an extensive hiring process waiting to perform gigs, but eventually we plan to expand to others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our biggest focuses is on making this program valuable to everyone involved. The &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; can definitely become a race to the bottom, and we don&rsquo;t plan to let that happen on our watch. Yes, there are a lot of people who can perform tasks online for incredibly low (and potentially unethical) rates; tasks at ATB Gigs are performed by and for Albertans, and we&rsquo;re committed to providing a living wage as the bottom floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, we want to make sure that business owners are confident in the people they&rsquo;re hiring to perform gigs. Our talent goes through a high calibre screening before they&rsquo;re able to accept and perform gigs. And similar to other platforms like Airbnb, ATB Gigs will rely greatly on a ratings and review system to provide honest opinions before entrepreneurs click the &ldquo;hire&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still a lot details for us to fine tune before the official launch, with variables we&rsquo;d like to test along the way. For instance, we&rsquo;re exploring a system to put a portion of students&rsquo; pay directly into savings or investment, while also making sure the platform offers a life-changing solution to business owners. One that allows them to customize the hiring process and think about their business in an entirely new way and find unique and efficient ways our ATB Gigs team can truly help the days flow better. One that can even work as an HR &lsquo;testing&rsquo; tool, allowing business owners to &ldquo;trial run&rdquo; an employee, so to speak, before choosing to bring them on full-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever entrepreneurs can dream up for their business, we want to be there to help.

What you may not know is that while she seems pretty simple on the outside, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to Pepper than meets the eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing we get asked a lot is what it&rsquo;s like to work with a robot. The completely honest answer is that it depends on her software. When she first arrived with her basic software, Pepper liked to answer questions about herself in a cute and funny manner. When we reprogrammed her, however, to focus on banking and a set of very specific tasks, a bit of her whimsy faded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let that get you down, though. Pepper isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; by any stretch of the imagination. We&rsquo;ve been learning so much about her, where she works best, and how she interacts with you (and vice versa) and iterating her software based on those learnings. Quite fittingly, one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned people prefer a polite robot; &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we work on improving Pepper&rsquo;s manners (and gradually moving her towards AI&mdash;something we&rsquo;ll elaborate on later), we&rsquo;re focusing on putting her to work in new contexts that aren&rsquo;t always based in our branch network. We think Pepper would be very helpful in situations where people need financial info but can&rsquo;t necessarily access it. Places like showhomes, where visitors may need to know more about how mortgages work, have their finances assessed, or get approved for a mortgage, or at university welcome weeks, where new post-secondary students may need to learn more about accounts or loans. We also want to test her out with creative entrepreneurs, so we&rsquo;re sending her to the Vignettes Design Series in Edmonton to meet with artists, designers, and other creatives and educate them about our upcoming arts and culture branch. When things get complicated, Pepper will always be accompanied by a human who can take over as required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it may sound like a lot, this phase of work with Pepper is actually quite short and sweet, and it&rsquo;s important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t a situation where you can judge a book by its cover. What you see in Pepper today, or tomorrow, or next week, isn&rsquo;t what you get. It&rsquo;s her insides&mdash;her software&mdash;that hold the real magic, and we&rsquo;re working furiously to get her to where she needs to be. One of the coolest parts about working with Pepper is that we don&rsquo;t actually know where she&rsquo;ll end up.&nbsp;<strong>The research is dictating the path over time, and every use case we test becomes either a building block or another step in the process of elimination.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while working with a robot may not be as cinematic as you think&mdash;sitting in a lab together having in-depth conversations with Pepper while various engineers connect wires to her, etc., etc.&mdash;we think she should definitely stay on your radar, because much is yet to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for talented people to join us on our journey.

You might be living in poverty. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have a safe place to sleep. Maybe &lsquo;home&rsquo; is an elusive concept instead of a place to go. You might be struggling with mental health challenges or addiction. All of these points of vulnerability could result in a situation where it&rsquo;s difficult to obtain - let alone hang onto - proper identification. And without identification, a safe place to keep the money that you do have isn&rsquo;t possible. For many in our community, this is their reality and a bank account - an opportunity to keep their money safe and grow their wealth - becomes a figment of the imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that access to banking is a basic right. With that guiding philosophy, enter Four Directions Financial, one way we&rsquo;re helping those in the Edmonton community that are vulnerable access banking, know that their money is safe, and maintain their pride and dignity. Part of ATB&rsquo;s agency network, Four Directions Financial is located next to Boyle Street Community Services, which has been serving inner-city Edmonton since 1971. We partnered in 2016, combining our financial and technological know-how with Boyle Street&rsquo;s expertise in supporting those in poverty, to provide vulnerable people access to mainstream financial services, often for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you walk inside the Boyle Street Community Services building, it looks like any other bank. But instead of requiring traditional ID, which is often lost or stolen, clients of this location can quickly and easily verify their identity through biometrics. As the first financial institution in Alberta to use biometric identification technology and the first in Canada to apply this technology to the underbanked, we use a simple, yet powerful black box to scan clients&rsquo; fingerprints and irises. Sixty-five per cent of Four Directions Financial&rsquo;s clients are registered to access their accounts through biometric identification. Others take advantage of Boyle Street&rsquo;s ID program (they use Boyle Street&rsquo;s address as their home address and then Boyle Street keeps the ID safe for them onsite).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to biometric technology, other unique features of Four Directions Financial include daily restrictions on withdrawals that are set by the customer, direct deposit of government cheques, and making the agency open to everyone&ndash;not just clients at Boyle Street.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With less time spent verifying IDs, more time is left for conversation. Marg, the Manager at Four Directions, knows many of her 520 customers by name. She spends time talking to clients about their lives and provides customized financial advice. Four Directions Financial merges relationship-based banking with cutting-edge technology. This affords hundreds of vulnerable people a safe place to store their money and take control of their finances. One-third of people who use Four Directions now have money left in their account at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work with biometrics extends beyond Four Directions - we&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID on all our apps and that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Upcoming advances include passive biometric solutions. We&rsquo;re currently conducting a proof of concept at the ATB Campus with facial recognition as a potential replacement for employee access cards, with a view to expanding to our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As technology evolves, so too must our approach and application of it. After all, what good is transformation when it doesn&rsquo;t make life better for those of us that need it the most? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want a job that makes meaningful impacts on peoples&#39; lives?

That customer-centricity is at the heart of our mission, our strategy and our bottom line - as is a core driver to deliver happiness and provide value beyond banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it only makes sense that, in our mission to transform banking by leveraging new and emerging technologies, we look to how these technologies evolve our fundamental customer experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brain Lab, an initiative of ATB Leap&rsquo;s innovation lab, was created to take a research-based approach to exploring the relationships between technology, neurology, and psychology. Led by Dr. Trudi Chalmers, a Behavioural Neuroscientist and leader at ATB, The Brain Lab will utilize the efficiencies of Electroencephalogram (EEG) Machines to interpret activity in the brain associated with technology interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Areas of research for the Lab will include: Fundamental Research, Product Interfaces, Performance &amp; Wellness, and Physical Meets Digital - all through the power of brain activity data procured from EEG testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fundamental Research</strong> is the foundation of the lab: Brain Data. Curating extensive secondary research published by institutions (such as The University of Calgary), coupled with the production of The Brain Lab&rsquo;s own data, we will create the data infrastructure required to support and validate the accompanying research areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Interfaces</strong> will explore the opportunities in beneficial, affective computing with digital products used in market today. We believe we can create metrics for intuitive digital design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring published literature, existing psychological and sociological data, social media, ATB&#39;s existing databases, and primary neuroscientific and psychophysiological data, we&rsquo;ll be able to more deeply understand how our brain and mind respond to both internal and external stimuli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance &amp; Wellness</strong> recognizes a priority for sustained brain health for our team members and customers. We believe the future of work and products will include the importance of environments where people can engage in their most impactful, happy mental states - and understand potential impacts of product utilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s well established that the use of technology can have some significant impacts on the brain - a fact many who regularly use smartphones can likely attest. Yet, as the rate of innovation increases exponentially, we intend to research how these emerging technologies will impact us in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Physical meets Digital </strong>will begin to create the agnostic product architecture required for changes in digital interfaces - and perhaps prepare us for a world of brain-computer interfaces, and the future of the IoT (Internet of Things).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By pulling back the layers on our interactions with our technology, we can begin to isolate and test impacts of our own products on the brain health of our customers, while also gleaning insights to inform future neural modeling that can scale past the human experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of scientific insight and transformational technologies, we can evolve our commitment to the mental wellbeing of customers and team members, while informing future work in the ATB AI lab. The Brain Lab will be closely linked to our AI Lab, ensuring the findings, data, and ethical considerations are closely woven into development of emerging technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there is ongoing debate around whether Artificial Intelligence Networks can be modeled off of the human brain, we believe deeply understanding our own human networks and interpretations of learning is the most efficient place to start. This is just the beginning of a long line of experiments aimed at helping us better understand the human brain, and the emotions, behaviours and actions that make us who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we embrace digital transformation at ATB, we have a responsibility to our customers to be mindful of the impact of our products and services, right down to a neural level. With every new product or service, we want to know we&rsquo;re aligned in our mission to positively impact our customers&rsquo; lives; precisely, in a way that we can measure and evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our mission? Building better products by transforming banking today, while investing in next-generation technologies for the benefit of Albertans tomorrow.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"30.01.2019","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/075/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/075/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"exploring-happiness-with-atb-part-1","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":8,"title":"Machine Learning"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":19,"title":"AI Lab"}],"labs":[{"id":3,"title":"AI "}]},{"id":78,"title":"The game of banking","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/078/ATB-AlphaBeta-Gameify_Banking-FINAL.gif","date":"15.02.2019 14:25","facets":[],"archived":true,"featured":true,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>The ATB AI lab is working in <a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\">partnership</a> with the University of Alberta on applications of AI and machine learning to create better banking solutions for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are leveraging the expertise of Alberta in reinforcement learning for first-in-the-world applications. The application of deep reinforcement learning that was famously used for solving games like <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/\">Atari</a> with defined rules and bounds is being applied by our team of researchers to effectively turn &lsquo;banking&rsquo; into a closed game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star of zero dissatisfied customers, our AI Lab is finding novel, real world applications of advanced machine learning with the end goal of improving our customer strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We recently sat down with one of ATB&rsquo;s data scientists dedicated to the partnership, </strong><a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/ualberta/\"><strong>Mark Sebestyen</strong></a>, who is on a mission to gamify banking and will explain how his team applies reinforcement learning to their data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why gamify banking?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason that reinforcement learning techniques work well for solving atari games, for example, is due to the strict rules of games - at any given moment in a certain state there are a finite number of options or actions with clear end targets or rewards and future scenarios to run through to select an optimal move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we can do is come up with a strategic algorithm for banking. The &lsquo;game&rsquo; we are trying to optimize is a multifunction optimization problem. Essentially, maximizing customer value while simultaneously maximizing value for ATB given a specific set of constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banking is complicated and complex. After all, we&rsquo;re looking at the financial wellness of individuals and their business. In order to take this complicated context and simplify it into a well-defined context, we start by identifying the three key variables of solving any reinforcement learning games: states, actions, and rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee661cd8366b89fdf8ebd/1543431783715/1.png?format=2500w\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The state</strong> is the financial context vector augmented with information relevant to financial decisions, banking needs and personal behavioural data. For example, a time-series of account balances on what banking products a customer has, how long they&rsquo;ve been banking with ATB and what specific interaction patterns they portray. Like in the game of Monopoly, each customer is a &lsquo;player&rsquo;. At any given time, they occupy a certain location on the board, have a certain amount of money, and have certain features. And at each moment there are a number of options that they have in working towards their goal of winning the game. That is where the action part comes into play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The action </strong>could be a customer action or an action taken by ATB. For example, offering a product, change of interest rates, or consultation on financial goals all the way down to the granularity of adjusting and personalizing the UI experience for that customer while they are logged into their online banking platform. Really our goal was to systematically go through all the actions we as ATB can digitally adjust for our customers and let our engine use those to come up with the best strategy for these clients. As an example, a feature product that can be powered by our engine is a digital banking platform that can continuously learn from and adopt to varying customer needs and will continue to learn more and more from ATB customers the more they use the platform. This is the most state of the art solution to deep personalization (this algorithm is literally straight out of the hot oven of RL research) and, to our knowledge, ATB could be the first bank that is using anything like this in application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The reward.</strong> Once an action has been taken in a certain state, the monopoly piece moves to a different position on the board. Here, we can evaluate whether financial value (e.g. investment portfolios as well as customer lifetime value, etc.) and other customer experience factors have increased, decreased, or remained the same. We do this through our own internal algorithms in combination with utilizing customer feedback and incorporation of survey results. As an example, after every google hangout session you get a mini-survey asking about the smoothness of the call. Similarly for us, these micro opinions can be easily incorporated into the platform and can provide huge value in custom tuning and deeply personalizing the UI/UX experience. For changes to our digital experience, a measure of reward may be the number of clicks it took to complete an action. For customer satisfaction and happiness, we may measure if they have moved further towards their indicated financial goals or look at how their engagement scores have changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"427x256\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc\" data-image-resolution=\"1000w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png?format=1000w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, <strong>problem constraints</strong> map out the boundary conditions - eg. everyone would be happy with a low or no interest MasterCard, but that is not something that we can necessarily offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that banking is not a game where you can boundlessly experiment with clients, which is why we are also committed to developing what we call in RL robust models. Thus, for example, our decision engine won&rsquo;t offer a MasterCard to a client already possessing that very product. In our models, this can be achieved by enforcing strict penalties for approaching bounds or violating game rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the K of N learner is a state of the art reinforcement learning technique for improving model robustness that we borrow from researchers on our team (Dr. Bowling and Dustin Morrill) as they employed similar techniques in solving the <a href=\"https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/michael-bowling\">game of Poker</a>. Test</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cepheus, a poker-playing program, was developed by one of the lead researchers on our <a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/about/\">ATB AI team</a>. Dr. Michael Bowling&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s algorithm is able to play a nearly perfect game of Heads-up Limit Texas Hold&#39;em. To quote Dr. Bowling, &ldquo;It is so close to perfect that even after an entire human lifetime of playing against it, you couldn&#39;t be statistically certain it wasn&#39;t perfect. We call such a game essentially solved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our &ldquo;game of banking&rdquo;, we sample N function distributions of the model at random from infinitely many choices while an antagonist fixes K of these distributions. The purpose is to train the protagonist to outplay the antagonist no matter how non-advantageous his fixed choices are. We need to still be able to choose the best solution regardless of what the adversarial fixed factors were. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"764x430\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional robustness is provided by testing our engines on certain data sets where states, actions, and rewards are very well defined, allowing us to closely monitor results and test robustness of our systems in the iteration process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are applying advanced machine learning models and computer systems to solve the problem of banking, we haven&rsquo;t lost touch with the humans behind it.

With Jackie&rsquo;s award winning work in designing service experiences across multiple industries including hospitality, health care, and business, and time spent working around the world, we knew she would help open up the possibilities and bring fresh perspectives to our in-branch experience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of our day-to-day activities shift online, from shopping, to catching up with friends, to changing details of our mortgage terms, so many experiences have gone from in-person to digital. This means that the role of bank branches and human-to-human customer service is continually evolving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we explore the value that we create through in-branch experiences, there are many lessons to learn from outside the banking industry.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the medical sector, there is a strong emphasis on &lsquo;helping&rsquo; and providing medical care. However, there is often a lack of &lsquo;service&rsquo; in the traditional sense. Think of the frustration of not knowing how long you&rsquo;ll be waiting in line or in a waiting room, not being welcomed with a friendly greeting, or having limited access to the information or services you need online. Not to mention the additional stress and anxiety of a sterile, crowded waiting room that adds to an already tense experience as you await medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrast this to entering a high-end hotel, where every part of the sensory experience is aimed at fostering a particular atmosphere and each staff member has the innate desire to serve and please guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a hotel, the arrival experience is critical. The sights and smells of a hotel lobby instill emotion&mdash;think of the cozy luxury of walking into the Fairmont Palliser in Calgary or the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton&mdash;or the energetic vibe of entering a W Hotel with vibrant colours and hip music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Of course, our goal is not to replicate a hotel experience within bank branches. The inspiration we have taken is about the human-centered approach to designing a space and providing optimized service through atmosphere and emotion that resonates with customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In designing our branches, we are purposeful in understanding the emotional state of customers when they enter, what they are looking to achieve, and how we can utilize space and technology to optimize how we deliver value and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One difference in banking is that the experience starts before a customer actually walks through the door. Entering a branch might be the third step in the customer&rsquo;s journey, as they &nbsp;may have already tried to process a transaction at an ATM or find the information online. When they enter a branch, they are looking to be assured that their problem will be solved, that they will be treated like a valued customer, and that their time will be well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we elevate the arrival experience in a branch? The first step we are taking is a co-creation process with our customers and branch team members to discover more about the emotional state and desires of customers when they enter. This will help us to design spaces and provide insights into how our customer service representatives can solve problems and alleviate stress for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the service side, language is a very important tool in the atmosphere created by staff.&nbsp;<em>Help&nbsp;</em>vs&nbsp;<em>Serve</em>.&nbsp;<em>Patient</em>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<em>Guest</em>.

But at ATB that&rsquo;s exactly what we strive to be. Being a large organization in an industry that is heavily regulated and risk-averse, it can be easy to stick to the same way of doing things because it&#39;s always been that way. However, we have always believed in finding the best and most value-driven solutions that serve Albertans &ndash; and that means being agile and forward thinking. One way we do this is by encouraging teams to leverage technology to create value-driven products quickly. We call these quick time to value projects and these projects are &nbsp;proven successful. The beauty of quick time to value projects is success comes almost immediately, as opposed to longer-term projects that take many years to provide all their value at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to deliver value to our customers, we need to deploy the right technology and tools for our teams. How can we make their days more efficient so that their time can be focused on what matters most: the people we serve? Enter ATB&#39;s Enterprise Data Science (EDS) team. They&#39;ve been working on clever ways to leverage existing technology to drive value within our organization by being dedicated to using data science techniques to solve everyday banking problems and ramp up efficiencies across multiple business units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the EDS-built tools now in use at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>The EDGuR1 chatbot</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Digging for information in a database, updating a timesheet, trying to remember the right acronym ... There are so many small, seemingly simple tasks and transactions that we (and all workers) do each day that add up and take away from our time that could be better spent on value added tasks. Built using the tools available within Google Cloud Platform, the EDS team created a fully functioning chatbot named EDGuR1 that provides team members fast access to hard to find, but easy to describe resources. The time savings EDGuR1 provides our team members, at a few minutes each day can amount to many people-hours saved &nbsp;on mundane task and instead on tasks that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Within two weeks EDS was able to build, deploy, and scale the chatbot at a very low cost and with minimal effort. Happier team members. Happier customers. Such a simple deployment of technology using existing tools and APIs had small, but transformational effects on the daily routines of ATB team members and is one of our favorite examples of quick, high value projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Optical Character Recognition</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a financial institution with significant business clientele, we regularly receive large amounts of financial information from clients, especially on business loans that are margined. In the past, this task required 12 full-time team members to go through each statement and manually enter information to calculate future loan values. It&rsquo;s a big task to say the least, and it takes away from our team members&rsquo; time &ndash; which is better spent on building client relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the past margined loans have been managed efficiently, and possible solutions of increasing efficiency are expensive and time consuming, often requiring third-party expertise. Instead our EDS and internal <em>Operation Automate</em> team collaborated over a short time period to develop a cloud-based automation tool leveraging Optical Character Recognition. This tool reads the text from incoming financial statements for margined loan accounts, and automatically extracts the right information and calculates the new margined loan amount, providing the customer with near-real-time access to their updated loan amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about how EDS built and deployed these solutions, we&rsquo;ll post an in-depth piece on this next time.

When we learn about a startup doing something interesting, we want to be able to find them, reach out, work together, and bring amazing opportunities and innovations back to Alberta, and to our customers. So this year, we held our very first innovation challenge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An innovation challenge is a fun, interesting, and rewarding way of solving a problem, because it invites startups from around the globe to submit their pitches and proposals for a chance to work with the creator of the challenge&mdash;which in this case, of course, was us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before we launched the challenge, we had to actually figure out what it would be. This process was surprisingly fun, and involved teaming up with Matchi (now owned by KPMG), a startup from South-Africa whose business was centred on connecting large financial service companies with innovative startups&mdash;essentially, acting as a fintech matchmaker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We landed on exploring customer onboarding and experience, and how we can make it even better, and nearly 60 submissions later, we&rsquo;ve got a new work buddy. Avoka, a fintech out of Australia, has powerful tools to streamline the customer onboarding experience, and we&rsquo;re now working together to figure out just how their technology could be applied to our unique environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first time in ATB history that we&rsquo;ve held an innovation challenge of this scale, and it&rsquo;s been an incredibly positive process. From getting our teams collaborating in new and exciting ways to working with new fintechs from the other side of the globe, we&rsquo;ve gotten so much out of the experience, and have discovered solutions we may have never discovered otherwise that we can bring back to our customers in Alberta in our efforts to continuously reimagine banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking to match with your dream job?

In our drive to lead the technology revolution of the banking sector, we&rsquo;ve been sharing our passion for areas like blockchain, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;<strong>This focus allows us to leverage a willingness to provide business banking solutions that go beyond traditional offerings.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a business banking client comes to ATB and says &lsquo;Sooooo, we&rsquo;re doing something a little different&hellip;,&rdquo; here at ATB, our ears perk up and we say &lsquo;how can we help?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s in our interest to make Alberta businesses across all sectors of the economy as competitive as possible and to make Alberta a place known for our openness to innovation: a great place to start and grow technology businesses.&nbsp;<strong>That is what we are setting out to do by working with businesses to create banking solutions that fit how business is done now and how it will be done in the future.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the oil and gas sector facing tighter margins, and the renewables sector exploding, the energy sector in particular is starving for innovative solutions and increased efficiency. We shared with you a while back our excitement about a blockchain proof of concept we have been working on for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/transactions-so-slick-you-might-slip\" target=\"_blank\">settling transactions for contracts in the oil and gas sector</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/49/\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re also supporting the great work of companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guild1.co/2018/02/14/guildones-royalty-ledger-settles-first-royalty-contract-on-r3s-corda-blockchain-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">GuildOne</a>; their innovative solution is streamlining fulfillment of smart contracts for oil royalty payments. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with royalty settlements in this space, think of an analogy of the music industry. When a song plays on the radio, there are a number of parties that may receive royalties at different rates: the artist, the song writer, a producer, etc...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contract and rates have been agreed to in advance, but when it actually comes down to payment, there may be different electronic copies of the contract flying around. Each party may perform the calculation themselves and then when payment comes through, if there are any discrepancies, it can result in huge delays and the need for many man hours of calculations, reissuance of payment, and a lot of time wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart contracts living on the blockchain can eliminate much of the waste and discrepancy by cementing the contract terms into a distributed ledger.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of oil royalty payments, contract negotiations are done separately and then cemented on the blockchain. Since ATB can read only the payment details of the smart contract directly from the blockchain, when a transaction is confirmed an Electronic Funds Transfer comes through and ATB initiates the fund transfer between parties. The smart contract in place truly is &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, we only see what we need to, which is the payment details. All other terms are kept confidential amongst the negotiating parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like a simple process, because it is.&nbsp;<strong>ATB&rsquo;s important role is our willingness to think outside of traditional banking.&nbsp;</strong>What we&rsquo;ve brought to the table is the option to initiate money movement based off payment instructions from a blockchain, rather than someone listed with signing authority on an account. Without this ability, fund transfer would have to be initiated manually by the payer, eliminating much of the benefit of the smart contract and the trust and reliability created by the blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no magic to it, but this is exactly what we&rsquo;ve been training for.&nbsp;<strong>We don&rsquo;t simply provide financial solutions based on traditional banking principles, we help businesses find solutions that fit the specific problems they are trying to solve and we bring our experiences with exponential technologies to the table.&nbsp;</strong>Are you looking to be part of the change that makes banking work for our Alberta businesses? Start your journey now,&nbsp;check out our open positions with the ATB transformation team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working on other proofs of concept that provide creative business banking solutions, for example real-time money movement off a blockchain. Our willingness to provide innovative business banking solutions is not limited to blockchain, as we continue to explore areas on the leading edge of technology, we&rsquo;re positioned to help Alberta businesses with the banking solutions of tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doing something a little different in business?

Although many assume these are on the distant horizon, we often forget that these are tools being put into MVP, pilot and practice across industries today. At ATB, one of our explorations into the combination of AI, Blockchain and automation is our application EVA, that has been deployed for more than 6 months across the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA (Easy Voice Autonomation) is one of the most nimble and effective projects related to AI, blockchain, and automation, and has the ability to exponentially transform banking. EVA is currently being leveraged within ATB to help us with our commitment to listen to our customers. Based on this commitment, we are focusing on improving the customer transactions experience &nbsp;that has resulted in negative feedback due to mistakes being made or the time taken to complete the task. We&rsquo;re also taking an &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; approach with EVA, by experimenting with EVA internally and gaining feedback from our team members prior to making it directly available to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blockchain we are using records processes, but not customer data. These processes are recorded where everything is secure and encrypted, as well as restricted by access permissions. &nbsp;This technology was chosen to enable solutions that are open and scalable, while ensuring its not dependent on a singular platform that could prevent us from expanding in the future. We chose to take on the challenges of blockchain to be at the forefront of this technology, exploring how we can use it to do what we do best: serve our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A current use case for EVA is the ability to save team members time and repetitive work when it comes to something as simple as changing an address. &nbsp;Connecting to the Canada Post API ensures the proper format of the address, saving ATB time and money on address remediation that many companies face in their customer records. Team members are able to enter address updates in one place and have that disseminated by the software robots who are fulfilling the request to each individual book of record where the information is required. &nbsp;Be it a customer profile, Mastercard or Investment account, customers can rest assured that all their accounts are updated accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the future, the goal is for EVA to anticipate our customers needs and take the onus off the customer for things such as address updates. Observables will allow for people to choose who can see and share their information and allow companies to pre-emptively update requirements when customer share. Imagine not having to call every company with whom you interact to update your address when you move, just simply allow these companies to listen for the updates you choose to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of EVA within ATB is to be able to rapidly create solutions that can transform the way we work and ultimately provide better customer service. It is because of this that we&rsquo;ve also&nbsp;chosen to incorporate natural language processing to better capture, translate, and figure out what the user is trying to accomplish when working with a given solution. The aim is to simplify every day tasks and make us more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EVA has been embraced by our robotics processing team and they are using EVA to build solutions for team members. As these solutions have been rolled out throughout the organization, it has allowed us to determine what features people inherently use, and which features need prompting, encouragement and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA allows branches and departments to solution for themselves, as opposed to being dependent on traditional IT departments or software development teams. This &ldquo;self serve&rdquo; ability saves time, money and manpower. EVA enables everyone to be part of the solution. &nbsp;We currently have 24 processes deployed internally to our team members that are fulfilled on the backend by our software robots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of EVA could be in a myriad of directions, as what we&rsquo;ve built is malleable and scalable which allows for future pivots and iterations. We could look at different use case applications within ATB, or even give back to the open source community by sharing knowledge with (and learning from), the incredible developer talent in our own backyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are committed to transformation at ATB and our stories are not done yet.

For any high performance team, it&rsquo;s THE F-word.

Here is how we define failure in a way that allows us to celebrate and learn from it at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Recognizing when you&rsquo;ve taken the wrong path in reaching a particular goal and either switching paths or becoming stronger from taking the long way. Just because you are on the wrong path doesn&rsquo;t mean that you won&rsquo;t eventually get to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&lsquo;Failure&rsquo; is a temporal state on the path to a solution&mdash;like a baby learning to walk, an individual fall does not mean that success is not the ultimate outcome. In embracing and learning from mistakes and failures, we are ensuring our eventual success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We learn by doing, instead of watching. Being the first to attempt something new is a great way to increase your chances of failure, but we are brave enough to try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move through our transformation and adopt an agile mindset across the organization, it is crucial for our leadership and team members across ATB to have a common understanding of what failure is and why we celebrate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The micro failures, the day-to-day choices and decisions that come with the agile mindset are opportunities to be humble, correct our path, and learn quickly from our mistakes. This pivot in thinking is part of how we can shift from incremental change to 10X leaps. Being able to change paths, or adjust the target entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got the tools to help team members think and talk about failure in a way that helps move us forward. Things like a failure toolkit with survey insights, our definition of failure and the reasoning behind this shift in mentality. We engage, leveraging internal platforms such as transformation talks and G+ communities where we socialize and reflect on individual and team failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to think of it, you might say that we have already &lsquo;failed&rsquo; at celebrating failure. With our most recent surveys showing only 50% of the organization aligned with our definition successfully celebrating failure. We may not be at our target yet, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we won&rsquo;t get there. Whether we are developing new banking tools, or working to change our company culture, we take the learnings and celebrate failures, because we have faith it will make our solutions even stronger.

It was the first ever Google Cloud deployment in North America and the first large-scale full production deployment of the SAS Viya software in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data analysis is core to our mission to provide better banking services and improve the lives of Albertans. From risk analysis and fraud detection to mobile app customization and customer service improvements, high powered data analytics can unlock huge returns in how we serve our customers. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re committed to equipping our teams with the tools to leverage machine learning, robotics process automation, computer vision, and natural language processing. Rather than having distinct groups of experts in charge of applied technology, we want team members across the organization to ideate and prototype solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of the key strategies to put the power of advanced technology in the hands of more ATB team members is founded on cloud deployments and powered by solutions like SAS. The Viya software, in particular, provides friendly user-interfaces in multiple programming languages and integrations with other technologies like Google Tensorflow.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our technology teams shift from developing tools to providing services, we need a platform that gives us access to open source and proprietary algorithms in machine learning. The Google Cloud deployment of SAS Viya allows us to do just that and empowers team members to use cutting-edge techniques to solve problems with advanced model management&mdash;reviewing and validating models before deploying in products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a multistakeholder partnerships between ATB, SAS, Google, and Hortonworks, we successfully made the inaugural deployment of SAS Viya on the cloud.&nbsp;<strong>With the platform in place and with wide access across ATB business teams, now team members can focus on what they are good at: applying AI and ML to solve problems and make banking better for Albertans.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful deployment is a reward in itself, but we&rsquo;re proud of the collaborative effort and happy to celebrate the project as we build on it for even greater successes in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in being part of the ATB team working on innovative and collaborative projects?<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">&nbsp;Check out our live job postings.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"21.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/016/v_768_ATB-AlphaBeta-InnovationAward-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/016/v_500_ATB-AlphaBeta-InnovationAward-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb","tags":[{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"},{"id":13,"title":"Partnerships"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":16,"title":"Data"}],"labs":[]},{"id":15,"title":"Customer onboarding in the era of apps: All aboard the Onboarding Express","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 22:50","facets":["progress","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":true,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Accepting status quo in customer experience at traditional financial institutions is no longer acceptable. There was a time when the only option for customers was which bank to go with. In the age of fintech startups, cryptocurrencies, challenger banks, and virtual finance, the experience of banking is no longer siloed in the eyes of consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers are comparing their banking experience to the magic of getting out of an Uber &lsquo;without paying&rsquo;; the ease with which you can rent out your house on AirBnB; or signing in to Slack with a &lsquo;magic link&rsquo; instead of a password you&rsquo;ll never remember.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are taking the challenge head-on, inspired by what we&rsquo;ve heard from ATB customers: how they want to interact with their bank and their expectations for in-person and virtual interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure that we are providing exceptional experiences for our customers, we had to change some things about how we operate. One of those changes was the launch of our digital platform. Overlaying our legacy structure and processes, the platform allows our teams to build processes based on the human experiences, instead of the corporate structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first prototype built on the ATB digital platform is Onboarding Express. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/progress/four-minute-account-opening-shifting-from-transaction-to-human-interaction\">launching early in 2018</a>&nbsp;in a single branch in Calgary, it has now been rolled out to all 175 ATB branches province-wide and has been used to open over 200 new retail bank accounts. Not to mentioned giving our team members the ability to wow our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onboarding Express leverages the digital platform by eliminating the need to fill out information on multiple forms, destined for different departments, and to have customers repeat the spelling of their names and their exact address multiple times as it is entered in different systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because we have automated connections between back-end portals and removed transcription errors with solutions like scanning driver&rsquo;s licences, our team was able to overcome the constraints based on business processes and focus on building an experience based on how we want customers to feel when they are opening an account with ATB.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re welcomed to a bike-share app, it can be as pleasant as scanning a QR code on your phone and hopping on your bike in less than a minute. With this in mind, we knew there was a better way to be welcomed into the ATB family.&nbsp;<strong>As we build life-long and multi-generational relationships with ATB customers, we really care about making a great first-impression to show customers that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll treat them for a lifetime.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Onboarding Express marking the inaugural success on the digital platform, our team has already begun working to improve other first-impression processes, like business banking and mortgage approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital banking platform connecting back end systems and opening up our ability to connect with APIs is what powers these types of solutions. Soon we&rsquo;ll be connecting our systems with external data like corporate registry information, digital document signing systems, and data storage platforms. Without the digital platform, it would have been nearly impossible to set up these sorts of integrations while maintaining a delightful customers experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we look at different ways to enhance the experience of banking, we&rsquo;re drawing inspiration not just from our own industry, but from the best apps, companies, and experiences out there. And most importantly, listening to Albertans about how they want to experience banking.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for a new bank account and you have five minutes to spare? Pop into any ATB branch and we&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ll leave a little bit happier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining the Customer Onboarding and Experience team eager to make banking work for people?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\">Check out our open positions.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"21.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/015/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"customer-onboarding-in-the-era-of-apps-all-aboard-the-onboarding-express","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":44,"title":"From transaction to human interaction: UX powered rapid account opening","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/044/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:56","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<h2><strong>How can enterprise architecture transform UX and CX?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about the last time you opened a new bank account. You probably braced yourself to wait in a line or a waiting area; and if it was in the recent past, you made sure your smartphone was charged so you could scroll the news feed while answering procedural questions coming from someone immersed in their computer screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead and Google &ldquo;How long does it take to open a bank account?&rdquo; The answer varies from 30 minutes, to two days, to ten days. We&rsquo;re out to change this. And we&rsquo;re doing it by shifting our sights from corporate requirements to user and customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of getting our account opening process to under 4 minutes began with ATB Transformation team members spending &lsquo;a day in the life&rsquo; of frontline staff. What better way to uncovered pain points? As the &lsquo;First Encounter&rsquo; for ATB customers, account opening seemed like a fitting pilot to test new systems and break down barriers to human centred service delivery. With this goal in mind,&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>he team set out to move from &ldquo;how do you spell that?&rdquo; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s dream together&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>and see if they could meet a challenge put forth by our Chief Transformation Officer,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Wellington_ATB\" target=\"_blank\">Wellington Holbrook</a>&nbsp;to open a brand new account (including debit card in hand and Online Banking set up) in four minutes or less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain why the seemingly simple task of setting up a new account can be so complex, we have to lift the curtain a bit behind the complex workings and regulatory requirements of a Canadian Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the siloed corporate areas of a bank operated independently. For example, the risk and compliance side of the business has certain requirements for account opening. Then add a layer on top of that for opening a debit account. And another to apply for a credit card.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the old model, each siloed team has a different tool, screen, or form, and different information requirements. What happens typically is frontline team members are left to manage different systems and processes that don&rsquo;t work together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution that the Transformation Team created is built on a&nbsp;<strong>versatile digital platform that will help us elevate and integrate processes, making it easy to deliver best in class experiences</strong>. It streamlines the process for ATB frontline team members and&nbsp;<strong>overwhelmingly improves the account opening experience for ATB customers.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially what the new process looks like for customers and ATB team members is an easy scan of a driver&rsquo;s license, a few on-screen questions to answer, and then in the back-end, the system transforms the information into the right formats and makes service calls to underlying systems in our separate corporate areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The old process was built around the bank&rsquo;s and the regulator&rsquo;s requirements, with the customer experience coming second. The new one is built for user and customer experience first.&nbsp;</strong>It converts the &lsquo;transactional experience&rsquo; of the past to a more human interaction. For ATB, this means we&rsquo;re saving time and streamlining processes. But for our frontline staff, it means they can be dreaming with customers, not typing and re-typing information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A rapid account opening process means team members can spend more time learning about their customer&rsquo;s dreams and goals, and setting them on a path to happiness. Or it means we can help customers get in and out quickly, confident that they have the banking products that they need.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we&rsquo;re not just solving one problem at a time. The key to the solution is enterprise architecture, a new platform that sits on top of the underlying corporate structure and processes here at ATB. Our internal teams building off of the enterprise layer are now able to focus on building the best experience, rather than worrying out integrating processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re changing banking by focussing on the experience we want customers to have, and then applying technology to make that a reality. We&rsquo;re piloting this rapid process now, and already looking to apply the principal to improve experiences from mortgage lending to business banking.&nbsp;<strong>We want to find more ways to spend less time on the transaction, and more time on the human interaction.&nbsp;Are you interested in being part of meaningful projects just like this?

For example: increasing total deposits, creating cross-selling opportunities, acquiring new customer segments, or providing liquidity. The downside of challenger brands founded on the business need of a parent company is that they often come with a lack of inherent user-focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, independent challenger banks face a number of other obstacles - they may have a completely different operating model, and potentially lack a banking licence (which means that customers don&rsquo;t benefit from deposit insurance). Alternative models are often built specifically for a customer need and can involve pre-paid cards, creative product structuring, personal financial management tools, or great mobile applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A potential downside faced by independent challenger banks, particularly in North American markets, is a lack of trust, which can be an enormous barrier to customer acquisition in the banking sector. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, as we explore our own challenger brand, we are learning from both the institutional sub-brand model and the startup approach, looking to leverage the upside of each while avoiding mistakes and pitfalls. How do we build banking for the growing segment of the population who are &lsquo;digital natives,&rsquo; no matter their age, without being weighed down by assumptions about what &lsquo;banking&rsquo; is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than starting from scratch, we&rsquo;re coming in with the the power, experience, and resources of an established institution. In the founding of the Transformation Team at ATB, we&rsquo;ve harnessed the grit, passion, and agility of a startup, and now we&rsquo;re applying those skills and taking the best from both worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing a challenger brand is more of a &lsquo;mindset&rsquo; than a set process.

We are striving to identify customer problems and to respond to opportunities the moment a customer need arises. To achieve this, one of the research streams at the ATB AI Lab is geared towards building a real-time Artificial Intelligence system. With vast amounts of data, we need to distinguish signals from an ocean of noise, so we are using big data techniques to process incoming data streams and we&rsquo;re applying machine learning algorithms to extract informative behavioral signals. Make sure to subscribe to alphaBeta to get more details about &nbsp;the complex problems that our research teams are tackling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our partnership with UAlberta, we are able to invest resources into a flexible platform &nbsp;instead of a single-purpose solution, that enables collaboration and will help us build for tomorrow. Decentralization and modularity are core to this model, so we&rsquo;re creating an &ldquo;extensible platform&rdquo;: blended with architecture, language, and interfaces that will enable different components created by a team of researchers &nbsp;to co-exist and interact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re building an early prototype in a cloud-based infrastructure, focused on data storage, processing capability, machine learning algorithms, and APIs. Our microservices-oriented solution connects all the components of the system together, joining messaging buses, with mathematical models and databases to query data for real-time event detection. New components can be easily created and integrated into the overall system. The setup is like a &lsquo;social-network&rsquo; for different components, allowing them to interact, and accommodate each other without significant dependence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why does industry-academia partnership benefit from a microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with academic institutions provides a unique experience, in part because academic research tends to be horizontal in nature, with researchers working independently on different components of the system architecture. For the ATB AI Lab, building a microservices setup that is flexible, portable, and adaptable means that we can quickly change our tech stack when new challenges arise, without building an entirely new solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than working separately and trying to integrate technical pieces at an mature project stage, we can add and remove components, include different databases, data transformation pipelines, and predictive modeling modules to react quickly to make sure we are at the forefront in solving problems for our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why start with a prototype of the microservices solution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research partners are experts in their fields, but in some cases are not entirely familiar with banking. Launching a prototype phase gives teams a playground to get used to the types of data that we have and the types of problems we are solving in banking. It also provides us an opportunity to test the onboarding of new research teams and academic &nbsp;partners&mdash;a sort of training phase before the wheels come off for both us and our research partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to giving the researchers a sandbox, our in-house data science teams were able to see the immediate value of this prototype and are quickly deploying successful &nbsp;solutions based on proofs-of-concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we deepen our research partnership with UAlberta, we are excited to be building more than a single purpose technical solution - our aim is to have a system where components built by researchers, students, and ATB data scientists can interact seamlessly. With this system, we are translating the power of machine learning algorithms to applied banking solutions, to make banking better.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"24.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/019/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time","tags":[{"id":4,"title":"AI"},{"id":8,"title":"Machine Learning"}],"labs":[]},{"id":14,"title":"Challenger banks and embracing irrationality in banking","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/014/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 21:46","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Challenger banks (also known as neobanks or sometimes online-only banks) are pushing the traditional banking sector with novel solutions, user centric products, and impressive traction with customer acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them, challenger banks are independent companies or nimble brands under the umbrella of established financial institutions. They can be skunkworks operations targeting a new business model, customer segment, cost structure, brand, or strategy. They vary from startup companies providing a full range of banking services, to smaller, specialized brands with one or two specific offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard rumblings that ATB is launching a challenger bank. Well it is certainly true that we&rsquo;re always looking to challenge ourselves&mdash;and what better way to do that than to take a team of exceptional team members and set out to develop a standalone banking solution that creates better experiences for people in life, not just in banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;re focussed on challenging is the fundamental perspective that banks are meant to help people be responsible and rational with their money. Because banking is something that is done to you, not for you. We don&rsquo;t want to change people, we want to support who they are by providing banking services that are delightful, simple to use, and improve the experience of daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banking is a very rational dimension of life. However, what people feel about their money and finances exists on a separate plane, one that is driven more by emotion than rationality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we started looking at how we could challenge ourselves and the banking sector, we started out not just by looking at what other challenger banks are doing around the world, but we also took the time to stop and listen to what Albertans want. With over 600 one-on-one interviews and dozens of focus groups to-date, we&rsquo;ve uncovered valuable gems about what people want from banking products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what we uncovered is that banking products are not necessarily broken. We don&rsquo;t have to entirely change how chequing accounts and credit cards work. We uncovered that people want digital offerings that help them do what they are already doing outside of banking. For example, vault accounts where people implement their own controls on how and when they can access their money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re serious about finding out how to make banking feel good, which is why we&rsquo;ve partnered with researchers from the University of Calgary to validate customer feedback on banking and user interfaces that create happiness and reduce stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of challenger banks is that they are not weighed down by legacy systems. In many cases, the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind processes and requirements in banking is like the pea at the bottom of a pile of mattresses. We&rsquo;re committed to peeling back to the fundamentals, breaking paradigms, and stepping out of the traditional perspective to embrace irrationality and the human aspects of finance and banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We want to open as many channels as possible for customers, so they can drive the experience, rather than saying &lsquo;here is the right thing to do with your money.&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put the power in the hands of our customers, we are building a flexible operating system based in the cloud and partnering with incredible companies like <a href=\"https://www.technisys.com/\">Technisys</a> out of Argentina and other top fintechs through API interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Albertans, at ATB we&rsquo;re not the type to sit back while the world changes around us. We&rsquo;re taking this challenge head on, getting our hands dirty to challenge ourselves, and banking. Can&rsquo;t wait to hear more?

But in reality, to run a business, hire staff, buy servers/equipment, rent an office, and pay utilities and taxes, every business needs at least some fiat currency. This means that <strong>cryptocurrency ventures in most cases still need to rely on business banking services from more traditional banking services providers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it can be challenging for cryptocurrency-focused ventures to find business banking services through traditional banks. This is particularly the case for up-and-coming Canadian crypto exchanges looking for business banking services here at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not without good reason that, historically, cryptocurrency has been taboo for banks. <strong>The anonymity and barriers to satisfying regulatory requirements that are the foundation of many currencies and exchanges often make traditional business banking off limits. </strong>Banks are built upon the tenets of knowing customers, avoiding money laundering, and minimizing financial and brand risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As blockchain technology becomes more integrated across sectors and cryptocurrencies take a growing place in the financial and business landscape, <strong>lack of knowledge, balancing needs of various customers, or fear may hinder more traditional financial institutions from taking part in this growing segment of the economy.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is not afraid of testing new waters, so we started the journey of exploring the risks and opportunities of cryptocurrency banking services. We started by carefully examining the different segments of the cryptocurrency space and identifying areas where ATB could feasibly work within regulatory compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we first explored the possibility of providing business banking services to firms operating in the cryptocurrency space, our traditional risk and compliance measures resulted in a big &lsquo;NO&rsquo;. This provided us with an exceptional opportunity to look again at our systems to see how we might be able to get to a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Working directly with our in-house experts, we made the big first step of identifying KYC (Know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money-laundering) thresholds that would have to be met in order for a business to qualify for business banking with ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crossing the threshold of banking with a cryptocurrency based business would be a big thing for a traditional institution like ATB.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a perfect fit for ATB to lead the way on business banking for eligible cryptocurrency businesses in Alberta. We see benefits for ATB, our clients, and for the overall economy. For our eighty-year history, we have been dedicated to transforming quickly to support Albertans as they build businesses in an ecosystem known for innovation, entrepreneurship, and calculated risk taking. ATB understands that different business sectors have different banking needs, they don&rsquo;t all fit in the same box. We&rsquo;ve done it before with <a href=\"http://www.atb.com/business/experts/arts-and-culture-branch/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">business banking for Arts and Culture</a> and now we&rsquo;re learning how we can support cryptocurrency business with banking services..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will be part of the future. Being a jurisdiction known for supporting businesses and fostering a developer community around new technologies has great potential to positively impact the entire business community in Alberta.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got our foot in the door, we&rsquo;re looking to the future for how we can overcome barriers to provide the next generation of business and consumer banking products and services that Albertans need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in bridging the gap between cryptocurrency businesses and banking services?

The traditional approach for technology infrastructure and applications is: reuse first, then buy, and if there is no product that fits, build.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ATB is dedicated to constantly innovating, iterating, and improving. This means having organizational infra</strong><strong>structure that sets us apart with speed and agility, helping us bring smart ideas to life quickly.</strong>&nbsp;In 2017, we took a hard look at our processes and infrastructure, including our &lsquo;reuse, buy, build&rsquo; hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our investigation, we were reminded that buying a product can have some serious pitfalls. Though often commended for being the cheaper and quicker option, going with an off-the-shelf software has risks of incompatibility and limits in functionality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customizations can also lead to nightmares when new versions are released. We dare you to find an IT manager who doesn&rsquo;t have a story to tell about getting so deep into customizations that a simple update can mean a system (and mental) meltdown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ve flipped the model on its head, moving &lsquo;build&rsquo; above &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. The build-first model requires an up-front investment that can prove challenging for many organizations. It also means that tools can take a little bit longer to get into the hands of team members, but the time and human resources investment can pay off big.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So why go the custom-built software route? It comes down to customization and growth.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key to success with the new hierarchy is a team equipped with the skills and technology stack to feasibly build solutions. At ATB we&rsquo;ve got the talent pool and the same technology stack as the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first foray was to build the ATB Digital Platform that powers our rapid account opening process. The platform is the &lsquo;plumbing&rsquo; of a scalable system that overlays ATB&rsquo;s legacy infrastructure, creating a custom platform that is easier to scale to other systems and processes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we had the plumbing in place, we brought a group of ATB developers into the lab and trained them up on the tools that underlay the Digital Platform. Now we have a team of developers who are able to quickly scale custom solutions to problems faced by our internal teams and ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building the software ourselves means features are fully customized and not at the mercy of version updates.&nbsp;</strong>We are able to adapt the ATB Digital Platform quickly in response to changing needs. Building from scratch allows for the programs to grow with us, and the investment is scalable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buying a product might work for what we need right now, but what about five years down the road? A forward-thinking mindset eliminates future frustrations of working with lagging technology or, worse, being bogged down by updating and testing customizations or being forced to transfer everything over to a new system in a few years time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transformation Team at ATB has catalyzed many positive iterations in how we do our work. Our organization structure is now structured for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">customer experience-based design;</a> our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">teams are inclusive</a>; the way we design is built for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way/\">speed and agility</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/shipping-experiences-the-lean-startup-way\">.</a> In the name of innovation, we&rsquo;re not afraid to veto stale paradigms and provide meaningful solutions to problems large and small.

Normally renaming an internal department is not a newsworthy event, but as our traditional IT department became anything <strong>but</strong> traditional, the transitioned from &ldquo;IT Service Delivery&rdquo; to &ldquo;Technology Enablement&rdquo; reflected more than just a name change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change reflects a different approach to providing foundational IT systems and support. Our Technology Enablement team is the &lsquo;engine room,&rsquo; keeping the lights on and the systems powered so that team members can &nbsp;make enormous leaps like implementing <a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/reuse-buy-or-build-new-answers-to-old-questions-in-software-and-tech\">robotics process optimization</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/11\">,</a> <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">cloud deployments of the most advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">,</a> and <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/19\">microservices architecture for more flexible collaborative work environments</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/expandable-microservices-architecture-for-ai-collaboration-in-real-time\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are making huge changes as the entire organization moves towards agile methodology and the cloud, the tools and principles that we apply in Technology Enablement vary slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in Agile methodology, a Scrum team is very disciplined with a very focused goal. The &lsquo;fires&rsquo; that can arise in traditional IT can cause a huge distraction to a Scrum team. That&rsquo;s why we are taking care of all those fires so that IT teams in other departments can run disciplined Scrums without worrying about the underlying systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So rather than implementing full Scrum methodology, we use the agile mindset and apply the principles across our enterprise systems. We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of carving off dedicated team members, or ignoring fires, but we do have the principles of agile development that we can apply in a more traditional IT environment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key principles we have adopted is the automation of repetitive testing and regular checks of our core systems, freeing up team resources that used to be dedicated to continual testing of core systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discrete workflows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another principle we have adopted from agile development is breaking work into discrete pieces rather than massive upgrades or changes. Compartmentalizing changes allows us to allocate resources more effectively, knowing the &lsquo;steps&rsquo; means that we can pull team members off projects without disrupting entire processes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ceremonies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many agile methodologies have very specific ceremonies, like sprint planning meetings, retrospectives and standups. Many of these ceremonies are extremely effective for project communication, prioritization, and optimization workflow. Even without adopting the full agile methodology, many of the ceremonies of agile development prove effective for teams in traditional IT environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the big changes in our transformation at ATB has been moving to the cloud and to fully integrate systems. This transition is both a blessing and a curse for IT managers. Integration means things are connected, but the downside is that there can be dramatic ripple effects of changes especially as it relates to the taking advantage of the new techniques and features of cloud platforms. In the traditional IT space of running big, bulky systems, we have the added challenge of adopting the key principles of the agile mindset, while making sure that we are alleviating some of the curses of legacy large scale integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since traditional IT success is measured against availability, reliability, and security, we take a different mindset to agile development to compensate for the added downside risk of service interruption or failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we take pride in the fact that we are far ahead of many in the banking sector globally. Moving from mainframe systems years before many other large financial institutions. Our job in Technology Enablement is to make sure that the legacy and core systems are available, reliable, and secure, while providing ATB transformation team members advanced tools, technology, and power to live up to our mission of transforming the lives of Albertans through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB is about making your time richer. Our customer obsession infiltrates the entire organization. Our front end staff want to make our customers time richer. Our transformation team wants our front end staff to have the tools to provide the best service to customers. And, whatever name they go by, our Tech Enablement team wants to ensure that Transformation team members can spend their time where it is most valuable, with stable and reliable technology behind them.

In one sprint we can dedicate resources to optimizing the user experience, while the next is dedicated to implementing new product features. From simple bug fixes to launching digital products through new distribution channels, product managers must constantly weigh business and user needs to allocate resources towards the optimal vectors of improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks in part to this optimized development process, user interfaces have experienced massive evolution (think of the transition from typing commands, to mouse clicks, to touch screens), conversational user interfaces (UI) like virtual chatbots and voice assistants are beginning to rise up as the technology of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve previously shared details from the product team behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ATBFinancial/\">ATB&rsquo;s virtual assistant&nbsp;</a>in Facebook Messenger, including their<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/product-development-in-the-era-of-decay-of-delight\">&nbsp;fondness for &lsquo;decay of delight&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;that drives product improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re giving a sneak peak at how they are taking their passion, learnings, and experimentation to be ahead of the curve with natural language processing and the user interfaces of the future. Check out some of the vectors of improvement where the team is creating business and customer value with conversational UI, starting with the ATB virtual assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 1 - UX improvements: mapping natural language to intent</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is one thing to train humans to input commands that a computer understands. It is a completely other process to teach a computer to map natural human language inputs to intent.&nbsp;</strong>That is the first layer for our approach to conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving the user experience provides customers the solution to their problems with as little friction as possible. Improving confidence levels and increasing the scope of utterances is the key way to reduce friction for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From learning all the different ways that someone may ask for their account balance, to increasing the number of tasks that can be performed autonomously, every challenging question that a customer asks is an opportunity for us to learn and improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try asking any voice assistant or chatbot what the exchange rate is right now, you&rsquo;ll likely get a response, but it might not be the exact form you were looking for. From early users, we took this learning and improved the way the ATB virtual assistant responds. Now you&rsquo;ll get options for CAD to USD, USD to CAD, or links to other exchange rates. Making sure that users get the answers they are looking for, not frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 2 - Integrations for task completion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Following mapping an utterance to intent, the next layer in conversational UI is to perform an action based on the identified intent.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, it is crucial to integrate back end systems so that tasks can be performed autonomously. If Alexa is not paired to your phone, you won&rsquo;t get the song you requested. If Siri can&rsquo;t activate your messenger app, it will be hard to use voice to text your mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got strong collaboration between our internal data teams to provide the needed back end integration. That has also allowed us to provide features like push notifications with proactive and personalized notifications to customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Can you imagine if your cell phone provider proactively called you to tell you that there was a plan that would meet all of your needs and save you money? Probably doesn&rsquo;t happen now for most of us...what if ATB could do that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now testing a feature in the ATB virtual assistant that will track customers&rsquo; recent account fees and transactions, and will notify them if they could have saved money on fees using a different type of account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With conversational UI optimized for natural language processing and tied into back-end systems, the future is bright for creating frictionless banking experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 3 - Optichannel experiences to support conversational UI adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before on alphaBeta about our commitment to providing exceptional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/37\">optichannel</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optichannel-not-omnichannel\">&nbsp;</a>experiences, where customers can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As users become more accustomed to the capabilities and limitations of voice and text interactions, optichannel remains a crucially important vector of improvement for conversational UI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are striving for seamless optichannel experiences through a feature that allows customers to move from the AI based chat to a customer care agent within Facebook Messenger. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we work on expanding the tasks that can be autonomously completed, there are still instances where customers need to connect with an ATB team member. So if someone is chatting and they are faced with a problem that the bot can&rsquo;t complete - the bot can now connect them directly to a customer care agent who can authenticate the customer within the chat and provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recognize that dedicating development resources to maintain optichannel integrations will remain an important factor in adoption rate of conversational UI and we are optimizing our development time accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vector 4 - New channel implementation: the magic of channel-agnostic conversational UI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversational UI is fairly channel-agnostic. You&rsquo;ll talk the same way with a voice assistance through your smart-watch, phone, or desktop computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ATB virtual assistant, that means that the learnings we draw from our integration with Facebook Messenger can be easily rolled out across other channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the chief benefits of the ATB virtual assistant when we launched was having Facebook Messenger as the channel. ATB customers were able to connect with their bank in the same channel where they connect with family and friends. Our aim was to help people integrate positive financial habit building into a channel that they were already using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That channel was just a start for our conversational UI. Internally, we are working with a virtual-assistant-as-a-service model to deploy the user experience into different ATB properties. We have the capabilities to integrate the bot into channels such as the ATB website or our own mobile application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our development resources are dedicated to the vectors of improvement that will provide value to ATB customers. With the ATB virtual assistant, we&rsquo;re improving mappings of natural language to increase the scope of tasks that can be undertaken by the bot. We&rsquo;re making sure there is seamless optichannel integration and rolling out conversational UI into multiple channels to help integrate the banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much work to be done in fintech and across sectors in the capabilities and adoption of conversational UI, but we see its potential to greatly reduce friction in banking and an almost unlimited number of uses cases. We&rsquo;ll continue to work across vectors of improvement to create happiness through banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining the Transformation team and working on reducing friction in banking through conversational UI?&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/#divisions\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open positions</a></strong>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"29.05.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/028/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"vectors-of-improvement-for-conversational-user-interfaces","tags":[],"labs":[]},{"id":9,"title":"‘Partnership’ is the new best practice in vendor relationship management","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/009/ATB-AlphaBeta-Client_Vendor-FINAL.gif","date":"23.10.2018 21:24","facets":["connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>The world is swimming with technology applications that are made to solve problems that large companies face. For organizations, the holy grail is often to crack into the &lsquo;corporate client&rsquo; market. Whether it is enterprise software with long sales cycles and fully customized deployment, or a bottom-up effort getting individual staff members to push for company adoption of tools such as Dropbox or Slack&mdash;the key to success for many organizations is getting corporate buy-in and adoption of paid service offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not all corporate clients are equally attractive for vendors, especially those working in emerging spaces or applying new technologies in more traditional sectors, like banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recently had great success working with SAS on the <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/innovative-cloud-deployment-of-sas-viya-results-in-insight-award-for-atb\">world&rsquo;s first large-scale full production deployment</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\"> </a>of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud. Our eagerness to listen and learn doesn&rsquo;t stop with ATB customers, so we sat down with the project team to hear what made this project so successful and what makes a great client-vendor partnerships with the types of innovative technology companies that we&rsquo;re eager to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing we noticed when sitting down with the team was how tough it was to spot who works for ATB and who works for the vendor. From SAS, &ldquo;the greatest compliment we can get is to sit down with an executive team and have them think that we are in-house staff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we figured out who works where, we dug into the details to find out how the ATB + SAS Viya deployment team eschewed the vendor-client relationship to build a collaborative partnership. Here are a few of the things they shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Get organization-wide buy in. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is not enough for the direct client area to be great at collaborating with vendors. For institutions like ATB, deploying any type of new software or program requires buy-in and collaboration from many different business areas. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though there were some risks in undertaking an un-tried deployment of the SAS Viya software on Google Cloud, the project had strong support, not only from executive and project teams, but also procurement, finance, and legal. This was crucial to successful launch and keeping the project on schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Nothing beats face-to-face. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, electronic communications are fast and efficient, but building personal relationships and getting key parties in one room for important brainstorming or decision making can make or break a project. For the SAS Viya deployment, project members from Google, Hortonworks, SAS, and ATB gathered in Edmonton for brainstorming and project planning at the outset. Throughout the project, morning standups via video conference made sure that all parties were in the loop, with open lines of communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of in-person workshops allowed the multi-party project to work through issues like risk identification, security requirements, and optimizing network performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Start with trust. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our partnerships with vendors are more like a marriage than a sales transaction. And just like in a successful marriage, both parties need to be committed to giving trust freely, and earning it continuously. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve learned the hard way not to give specifications to a vendor and to blindly trust that they will deliver. But those challenging relationships haven&rsquo;t stopped us from giving trust where it is deserved. Trust means not jumping to contract terms and fighting to be right, but working through problems to find a common solution. Trust means being upfront about intentions and providing clear and continuous feedback about what is going well and what is not. Trust sometimes means forgiving mistakes and working to improve together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t just sell, solve. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because a tech startup got face time with a corporate client, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is a good fit. Both parties can suffer when there is misalignment between the client needs (or what they think they need) and what the vendor intends to design, or what they think the market needs. For a tech startup, landing a huge corporate client and then finding out that what they want requires a custom-build, or differs from where the product was headed, can derail future growth potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly on the client side, putting time and money into a technology solution that doesn&rsquo;t fit the exact use-case can be a setback at best, or detrimental at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With SAS, we dug into the use-case very deeply and found fundamental alignment to explore the new area of deploying SAS Viya entirely in the cloud. Together, we architected the solution, working on every piece of hardware being installed, the specs, the software, and configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the first step was making sure that we had alignment between the client-problem and the vendor solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ask the right questions. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we are working with a new vendor, there are some very telling questions that indicate whether it is going to be a great partnership. Here are just a few of the questions we love to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can you tell me about a time you <em>successfully</em> worked with a vendor my size?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can we send a staff member to work out of your office?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Can I call you unannounced?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>How can I help you succeed? What other solutions have you tried?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we strive to be the type of client that vendors dream of partnering with. Our teams are made up of passionate people, working on exciting projects to leverage data and change our business operations with the ultimate goal of making our customers happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not just picking a product to buy, we&rsquo;re choosing life-long partners and aligning ourselves with people. Both the client and vendor are better off working in partnership; the <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/16\">evidence is clear</a> that we can achieve more in architecting solutions together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like our partnership with our customers to help them create happiness in their lives, we look to partner with vendors who understand why we care and share our passion, determination, and commitment to creating value.

Here are a few of reasons why we are working with a &lsquo;roll-out-now&rsquo; mentality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Value &gt; Perfection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If there is an iota of immediate value created by the MVP version of the product, there is an opportunity cost to holding it back to a later stage&mdash;why wait when you could be creating value, solving a problem, or selling a product now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When our product team spent &lsquo;a-day-in-the-life&rsquo; with ATB team members in branches. We saw the urgent need to change the account opening process. Between the burden on staff of holding up a conversation while navigating multiple interfaces and the missed opportunity to add value with a brand new ATB customer, this was an urgent problem that needed to be solved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">With our new digital platform, it was the perfect time to prototype. Luckily, our in-branch partners saw the potential and were eager to test an MVP even through the initial bumps. For Onboarding express, the early roll-out validated that we were moving in the right direction and allowed us to collect feedback and make functionality fixes that meant better interactions and more smiles on the faces of both ATB staff and our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If it can start making team members and customers lives better today, we should put it in the hands of team members now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Phase-two never comes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Have you ever worked on a service or product roll out that had an elaborate plan for &lsquo;phase-two,&rsquo; but that second phase never came? That is one of the risks of rolling out a product that is nearly ready. If functionality is far enough along and value is being delivered, it is too easy to pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next big challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Rolling out while things are still clunky or broken means you have to keep working on it. Baby steps take much less momentum than jumping across a gaping crevasse, so it&rsquo;s easier to keep a project moving continually forward, with less risk that we might fall in or get distracted before taking off. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The early roll out not only pushed us to quickly improve functionality, but it also enabled us to incorporate important learnings that we might otherwise have missed. Things like loosening the character limits on the user names and increasing the time window to activate a debit card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We&rsquo;re still working on improving Onboarding Express, but somehow the crevasse is behind us and we&rsquo;re still moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>It builds a culture of adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Across the ATB Transformation team and the entire organization, we&rsquo;re building a <a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/fostering-a-culture-of-adoption\">culture of adoption</a>. That means team members are eager and willing to take up new tools and technology. They&rsquo;re willing to join in the building process because they share the belief that we&rsquo;re making positive changes that will create value for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Just like any muscle, we need to be constantly exercising our adoption abilities, building our strength. One of the critical factors of success when launching an early MVP is setting expectations. If users are expecting it to be perfect, they will be disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Part of our adoption process at ATB is inviting early users along on the journey, leveraging our internal communities, and creating excitement and open discussion around launch. Instead of rolling out a new tool to staff members who feel burdened, they are part the team building it and their feedback is heard and incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Our <a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/52\">Spark</a> team and internal communication team members were the catalysts, the engines, you might say, behind the success of Onboarding Express, keeping the lines of communication open and building momentum for roll-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our mission is huge: to elevate the human experience and create happiness through banking. We know that if we aim for perfection, we may never get there. What we are doing is aiming to be great, and striving to get better, every day. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch out world, the Onboarding Express is steaming ahead, and this is only the beginning, we have plenty of other exciting projects to follow.

Sometimes the design is purely aesthetic: &ldquo;Our website is out of date, let&rsquo;s design a new one.&rdquo; Other times, the design changes are founded in the user experience. These are the types of changes that customers relish, instead of shun. Not just new fonts, colours, and templates, but transformed digital experiences that are faster and more delightful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of our new digital business banking experience starts with our own internal transformation into a customer obsessed organization with an agile mindset. In our customer obsession, we uncovered that approximately half of our business customers use digital banking tools weekly, and a quarter of them daily. On average, business banking customers spend one hour per week with us across all of our digital banking tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the primary touchpoint that business banking customers have with ATB, we embarked on a mission to uncover how we can live up to our story and show our customer obsession through the digital business banking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our business banking customers agree: banking should enable business, not slow it down. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to take that hour per week and make sure that customers leave knowing that we are listening to their needs, that we value their time, and that we are committed to providing the best possible digital experience, not one that is just &lsquo;good enough&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From listening to our customers, we uncovered a few areas where our business banking services were missing the mark. For example, one of the first tools we are testing is removing unnecessary friction in the controls over business banking accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not every business is built the same, so why should business banking controls all be alike? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of limited options for varying user permissions and approvals, we want to give our business banking customers customization and flexibility to make sure that their banking procedures fit the needs of their business. Want to give an employee permission to pay bills, from certain accounts, up to a certain amount or daily limit, to certain payees, only requiring approvals if they need to exceed their limit? You should be able to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of new tools that fit the needs of business banking customers is account nicknames. We noticed that some business customers were creating account nicknames to sort their accounts based on business function or geography. Want to be able to group your accounts to see just the Edmonton office? We want to help you do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customers don&rsquo;t necessarily care what a website looks like, but in fact the design underpins the two things that users do care about: How quickly can I satisfy my need? And how does the experience make me feel?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why we are committed to ensuring that core banking needs of customers are met. Only once their fundamental banking needs are met and trust and transparency are established can we look to empower them and bring happiness to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like Alberta businesses, we are doing things in new ways because we know it will lead to a better outcome. With a growth mindset, we can all get there faster.

They&rsquo;re not usually crossing their fingers that users won&rsquo;t even notice a release or update. So maybe we&rsquo;re a bit of a different breed, because we revel in the decay of customer delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring many different technology solutions to customer problems, including<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">&nbsp;augmenting customer service with Pepper the robot</a>&nbsp;and exploring how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/34\">artificial intelligence (AI) can help make banking better</a><a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/does-the-world-need-another-ai-lab\">.</a> In 2017, we also launched our virtual banking assistant in Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The virtual assistant is an AI-powered consumer facing experience that allows a customer to type in natural language and receive an answer back from the bot. More than just a technology play or flashy product, with the virtual assistant, we aimed to solve a crucial customer problem. People want consistency in service and answers. And they want twenty-four hour access. We were able to provide just that, in a channel that customers can fully control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many users, the first time they interact with a bot, the novelty is delightful, as they engage in natural conversation with a machine and are amazed when it provides answers or completes a task. Think of your friend showing you they can turn the lights on and off with a verbal request or change the thermostat without moving a muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our desire is to deliver this kind of gratifying experience to customers, but we also recognize that when users interact with the virtual assistant, they want to feel as though they are in a conversation with their bank.&nbsp;</strong>This comes along with high expectations of what the virtual assistant can accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each interaction, the AI-powered chatbot is processing and understanding, using machine learning techniques to get better over time. The end promise is that each time you use it, you are contributing to it getting smarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest barriers to improvement is getting users to push the system to the limit. We are actually not hitting the edge enough. When people feel the delight of a novel product, or the frustration when it can&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, they are less likely to push the extreme boundary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we dig deeper into natural language processing and how humans interact with robots, we have developed a deep fondness for the natural decay of delight as people become more accustomed to what bots can do.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want people to constantly increase their expectations of the capabilities of a bot, as odd as that may sound, because it pushes us to continually improve and build new capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As market leaders, we have this great problem of being at the forefront of people&rsquo;s expectations. We can give them everything they want, then they&rsquo;ll want a bit more. That is what drives us forward. We are constantly discovering, and solving, new challenges - which is the most exciting part of what we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a product team, we&rsquo;ll always work on what has the most customer impact. Business value is customer value. Sometimes that means we&rsquo;re shipping brand new features. Sometimes it is simply: &lsquo;here is a fast stable product that you can trust to work&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Updates are not always announcement worthy, but that is actually the goal; people may not notice, remark, or comment, but we want them to have that increase in expectations and decay in delight, because it means we get to keep making the product better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the virtual assistant, we aimed to provide core customer and business value. And by no means are we done. The Facebook Messenger virtual assistant was a direct result of research and listening, with an ideal confluence of our internal capabilities, a great partner in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finn.ai/\">Finn.ai</a>, and the right channel with which to integrate. We are continuing to explore the many vectors and areas where we can make the experience better and applying our learnings to other high-value services for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you, like us, revel in the decay of customer delight.

With an engineering degree and analytical mindset, she has had a hand in prototyping early neural networks for speech recognition at Nortel, supporting Shaw&rsquo;s analog to digital conversion in television, and leading transformation strategy for the technology team at Enbridge as their Chief Technology Officer. She is also the proud owner of seven patents with the USPTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through her impressive career track record and technical background, one of the most pivotal moments for her was becoming a parent. &ldquo;My family makes me a stronger leader, and what I do in my career and in my work makes me a better mom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she is not changing the world through technology, Denise spends as much time as possible drawing inspiration from her children and spending time with family, where she still exercises her scientific side through her love of baking. &ldquo;I find baking quite cathartic. Measuring, cooking, enjoying the tastes and smells.&rdquo; And, just like how the science behind &nbsp;technology is not as meaningful or transformative without the people, sharing baking with friends and family is what really matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise says, &ldquo;being a parent really brought together the analytical and human aspects of technology for me. Technology is a science project, but transformation is about culture. A trusting, safe, open, and transparent environment is critical for true transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At ATB, I see an environment that is embracing experimentation. That made me really curious, and made me want to be a part of it. I want to be a part of the excitement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is not afraid of making bold changes. After several years working at the forefront of intellectual property licensing for technology patents, Denise made a mid-career decision to go to law school. Partially to satisfy her thirst for knowledge, for Denise, &ldquo;going back to school later in life was an opportunity to see the world through a different lens. It really reinforced my love of technology and helped me think differently to see the world from different angles. It made me a stronger technologist. It also made me learn to read a lot faster!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denise is excited to bring her bold fearlessness and curiosity to lead ATB&rsquo;s digital team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are experiencing a perfect storm that is enabling disruptive technology. In Alberta, ATB is really at the forefront. It is incredible that we can drive digital transformation to serve Albertans with modern, agile financial services that were previously unimagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Banking is so personal. Everybody&rsquo;s needs around finances are varied. As ATB unlocks this data, we are able to provide unique, personal experiences that meet the needs of individuals. That is really monumental. Not many companies have embraced it to the level and degree that ATB has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than the opportunities for technological advancement, one of the biggest things that drives Denise is the ambition to leave a legacy and a better world for her children and for the next generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest things that drew me to ATB is the genuine desire to make a difference in Alberta and to build a strong, diversified, inclusive economy. Having seen the impact on people and families of economic downturns, I never want to see Albertans face that type of challenge again. If I can make a difference in that, that is very important for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is about growing talent, bringing diversity to our economy, ensuring that people have a livelihood through their banking and through their financial profile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her work in technology and transformation, Denise draws plenty from time spent with family. &ldquo;Kids today are growing up digital. I remember when I realized things were really switching when my one-year-old started trying to swipe the TV. She couldn&rsquo;t speak, but the whole world to her was digital, mobile, tactile. She thought everything worked that way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we&rsquo;re excited to grow along with the digital generation and find ways that technology can make positive change for Albertans. With Denise guiding our digital teams, we&rsquo;re in good hands.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"07.08.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/017/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"introducing-denise-man-leading-digital-transformation-inspired-by-the-next-generation-of-albertans","tags":[{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":22,"title":"Balancing model accuracy and explainability of machine learning models","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/022/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 20:00","facets":["progress","business","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>In early 2018, a team of ATB data scientists<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">&nbsp;competed&nbsp;</a>against some of the top teams in the world in a predictive analytics Kaggle competition. For the team competing, although there are many differences between applying their skills in competition versus their everyday work, there were incredible learnings to be had. Our team was able to explore methodologies, test a broad selection of feature engineering strategies, and try applications of high efficiency models like Light GBM and XGBoost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are key differences between professional application of data science and participating in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/using-predictive-analytics-for-social-impact-atb-competes-in-the-women-in-data-science-datathon\">Kaggle</a><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\">&nbsp;</a>data science competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Kaggle competition:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n\t<li>The focus is to win the competition by building a highly predictive model. In real life, the goal is to get useful results that can be interpreted and acted on;</li>\r\n\t<li>Success is measured by ranking criteria such as AUC (area under the curve) score. In life, predictive models have real-world impacts, consequences, and both quantitative and qualitative value assessment;</li>\r\n\t<li>Any technique that increases accuracy is fair, even if the final model cannot be explained fully. In life, it is crucial to understand the input features and their interactions in a predictive model to ensure that the model is robust, compliant, and can be trusted; and</li>\r\n\t<li>The jump from 96.83 per cent accuracy to 97.85 might put you in the the top 5% of competitors. In life, 85 per cent accuracy might be the target model fit, based on many different factors to weigh, including ease of model deployment and management.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In banking, we are impacting people&rsquo;s lives. So it is not just about putting the model into production that has the highest accuracy. Equally important, we must make sure that whatever we are proceeding with will work to the benefit of our customers and Albertans: ethics, transparency, and compliance are pivotal model design paradigms.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While high efficiency models can be exciting and beneficial, the availability of elastic compute engines and black box solutions puts additional scrutiny on data scientists to ensure that the models that are being used to make important decisions have been thoroughly validated. Interpretability increases in importance when applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in a Kaggle competition, ensemble modeling is a commonly used technique that can provide huge lift in accuracy of a predictive model. However, if applied in a real-life setting, we would need to apply techniques to ensure the model is explainable, including continuous validation &nbsp;and quality assurance so we are sure that we are impacting our customers lives in a positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of competing in a Kaggle competition is the opportunity to expose ourselves to new thoughts and ideas. Both in the application of algorithms, but also to expand our understanding of the impact of AI on the world. That is why one of the focus areas of &nbsp;ATB&rsquo;s&nbsp;AI Lab, launched in April 2018, is the ethical application of AI for people and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI Lab also builds on our learnings about the value of bringing together diverse thinkers. We are working with professors and graduate students from the&nbsp;University of Alberta&nbsp;across the fields of Math, Science, and Economics to help find the best solutions to customer problems at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way that great breakthroughs can be achieved in a Kaggle competitions by leveraging team members with diverse backgrounds and applying newer techniques and strategies, in real-life we are bringing theoretical research powered by a team from various &nbsp;disciplines into production at our AI lab. The diversity of thought is what leads to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re excited to continue our exploration of AI-powered future while remaining keenly aware of the dichotomy between the blind pursuit of model accuracy and the importance of keeping human ethics at the center of model design.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in joining us as we work towards building an AI-powered future grounded in ethics?

We&rsquo;ve changed the way&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAnHzDEP8GM\" target=\"_blank\">international money transfers</a>&nbsp;leverage Blockchain. Now, we&rsquo;re building systems for maintaining identity records. But we like to keep it in the community, so we&rsquo;re also using Blockchain to tackle a very Albertan topic&hellip; Oil Settlement Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, Oil Settlement Day was a very cinematic occasion. All the head honchos of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their chequebooks in tow, ready to settle their scores. It sounds like something out of the Wild West, right? The stakes were definitely high and the dollars (and maybe the ale, too) would flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil Settlement Day has since moved into the electronic world, but things aren&rsquo;t working as efficiently as they should. Right now, Oil Settlement Day is a drawn out process that starts a couple weeks before the 25th, with all sorts of reconciling and approvals that must happen so that funds can move on the big day. When the time comes, lots of the smaller companies need to wait for funds to arrive before they can settle their own contracts, so rather than a slick series of transactions, Oil Settlement Day is currently a bit of a clunky muddle. Within ATB, we have a group of employees who manually enter our system to process contract payments and make the money move. So for the oil companies&mdash;and for us&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is at a premium, and we know there&rsquo;s a better way to do this. One that marries trust with immediacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve developed a Blockchain proof of concept with the help of IBM that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including oil companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly. No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re testing the waters with this new and improved settlement process, but one thing is certain: this could have a huge, positive impact both on the oil industry in Alberta (and beyond) and on ATB. It could save time (and therefore money) for our clients, free up some of our staff for more meaningful work, and provide us with a groundbreaking new economic opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB we&#39;re always looking for talent to be part of meaningful projects just like this one.

In the innovation space, we talk about 3H methodology as a marker of market assuredness and risk related to technological change. In general, technologies further out on the horizon have riskier adoption prospects, higher technological challenges, and are riskier capital investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a consumer, it can be exciting to get the first release of a product or software, but it often comes at the risk of it not functioning perfectly, or a better model coming out shortly after.&nbsp;<strong>As a first-mover, you&rsquo;re taking on higher risk, with the hopes that the rewards will be greater.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an innovation focussed organization, we also have to be strategic about investing our time and resources in technologies that will have a real impact on our customers and our bottom line. That means balancing the mix of horizon-one, two, and three technologies that we invest in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>So what&rsquo;s on the horizon in banking?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon-one</strong>&nbsp;is an immediate market need. There is high market assurance that this technology or product is something that customers want. This is typically where the majority of capital goes. As market assurance goes up, so does overall capital. While investments in horizon-one technology are fairly safe in terms of demand, they are also highly competitive, as there is widespread market adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Machine learning today is a horizon-one technology. There are out-of-the-box solutions and there is high assuredness of demand for machine learning technology. However, applications of machine learning can take us into horizon-two or three. For example, at ATB we&rsquo;re exploring machine learning applied to natural language processing and robotics processing automation with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\" target=\"_blank\">Pepper</a>, our customer service robot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon-two</strong>&nbsp;is a bit further out on the technology curve, with about 60 per cent market assuredness. So you&rsquo;re pretty sure that it&rsquo;s coming and there is a market need, but there might be some technological barriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">An example of horizon two technology is voice interaction applied to home voice assistants. There has been significant uptake in the adoption of the hardware by first movers and the early majority but there are still some barriers to integration, kinks in the technology, and less than sure majority acceptance as we move down the technology adoption curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horizon three</strong>&nbsp;technologies are about the five-year out mark. There are likely high technological barriers and low assurance that the market will adopt the technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Imagine something that seems almost sci-fi now that could be part of everyday life in the not so distant future (think a few years back to what you thought of artificial intelligence or self driving cars). Looking forward, we could see implants taking over as the next phase of wearable tech and quantum computing revolutionizing encryption and the power of data analysis through machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finding the balance between investment across the three horizon technologies is crucial for any business that wants to keep up with the pace of technological change.&nbsp;</strong>As traditional banks compete with fintechs and with companies like Amazon and Apple making forays into finance and banking, it is more important than ever for us to be exploring all three horizons. When the next technological rocket explodes, we&rsquo;ll be at the helm, steering it to uncharted territories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think you can keep up with the pace?

We have previously shared our<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JD7tSGF6ulUQx3qWAlMyE3-HnuXixOz19CEp57u5-w4/edit?ts=5af9a6d8\">&nbsp;excitement</a>&nbsp;at being at the forefront with our virtual assistant chatbot powered by AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our team developing the ATB virtual assistant, applying machine learning techniques to improve natural language processing is a foundational effort. Incredible by-products of that effort have been the discoveries around how people interact with the chatbot on a human level, providing learnings that are transferable across user experience design problems we are working to solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of those learnings is that the chatbot has the intrinsic ability to increase the discoverability of the solutions our customers are asking for. The chatbot is able to break down barriers by providing a safe environment for customers to ask questions that can help increase their financial well-being.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain how a chatbot does this, consider, have you ever felt embarrassed to ask a question about mortgage terminology? Or looked for information online on how to change your debit card limits? It is human nature to feel self-conscious when one feels unaware or out of their depth. But people are often happy to ask these kinds of questions to a chatbot, when they also trust it to understanding what they are asking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another aspect to this &#39;discoverability problem&#39; is that customers don&rsquo;t always know exactly what they need or how to ask for it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of natural language processing (NLP) within the ATB virtual assistant addresses this problem directly. Think of the chatbot&#39;s NLP abilities as a patient and observant partner, truly listening and responding to the intention behind words rather than the words themselves. This act of listening to true intention is core to the virtual assistant and helps people discover the truth that they are looking for, in a comfortable way. Start with listening, layer in machine learning, and you will find a recipe for creating trust and engagement with users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deployment of supervised machine learning creates a positive feedback loop, where the NLP capabilities of the virtual assistant are constantly improving. Users themselves are constantly teaching the chatbot; each utterance contributes to its growing abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does it really mean when we talk about truly listening to a customer&#39;s intention and not just their words? Maybe someone gives an utterance, &quot;Hey, I lost my credit card, what do I do?&quot; As individuals, we read this and say, &#39;we should help this customer make sure their card is safe.&#39; In its own way the chatbot does the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great example of the end-to-end experience, as the chatbot can&#39;t simply hear you, but is also capable of responding and helping. Our teams work on both sides of the experience, augmenting the chatbot&rsquo;s NLP capabilities as well as deepening its connections to core ATB systems. Facilitating deeper, more data-driven, and personalized responses. The first iteration of a response may be simple content. If customers validate the importance of that response with their usage and feedback, the chatbot learns, allowing for stronger mappings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; guiding the ATB virtual assistant is our commitment to helping people discover the solutions they need, when they need them. Stay tuned to alphaBeta for more details about upcoming feature releases for the chatbot and how we&rsquo;re applying our learnings in user experience design to new channels.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"08.07.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/018/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"ux-learnings-from-atb-s-ai-powered-virtual-financial-assistant-chatbot","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"}],"labs":[]},{"id":48,"title":"Shipping experiences the lean startup way.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/048/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:02","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;re always looking for efficiency and process improvements, I mean, who isn&rsquo;t? One thing that we have embraced well here at ATB is the lean startup method as one of the many tools that can be borrowed from the startup world to bring efficiency to how we roll out new solutions and experiences, big and small. After all, it&rsquo;s not about the size of the solution, but the overall impact to the experience. Client care is one of the prime areas where the tenets of lean startup (like building minimum viable products, measuring impact, and validating learnings), are not only feasible, but crucial to providing the innovation that consumers have come to expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically in banking, you might assume that product and program launches have gone through 23 layers of administration, have only been tested internally, and take years to roll out and implement, sometimes rendering the final solution irrelevant in market. At ATB, our innovation team is constantly taking client problems and iterating quickly to find solutions and learn from &ldquo;the end user&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Referral Program with Alberta Registries is a perfect example of agile learning and delivering a product to customers as quickly as possible. As the bank for Alberta entrepreneurs, we are constantly looking for ways to add value, and save time. Here is how we took lessons from lean startup to quickly get a product to market to satisfy a real customer need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all started with a problem: how can we make it easier and quicker for new entrepreneurs to set up business banking? We started hacking for a solution by talking to entrepreneurs, and walking through their journey: who do they interact with, what are key milestones, and what other organizations are they connecting with? It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that any entrepreneur, at an early stage in their journey, will connect with an Alberta Registry Agent for their business license. It&rsquo;s at this step in their path that they take the time to begin to bring their dream to life. Once we forged partnerships with Alberta Registry Agents, within two weeks we had rolled out a prototype experience to tie together the business registration process with an easy referral for business banking, without any additional time required to find a banking partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t waste time building a perfect solution, instead we got a minimum viable product out into the world to quickly iterate and create a feedback loop to develop a solution that would meet customer needs. Today, all it takes is a few extra questions with the registry agent, a simple form that that the registry office sends over to ATB&rsquo;s Business Centre, and our specialists can start getting account details set up without a customer ever setting foot in a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of innovation that we are crazy about here at ATB. Obviously we are working on the tech heavy stuff as well, like AI, bots, banking through Facebook messenger, blockchain, and biometrics. But there are also vast opportunities for low risk, high impact innovations in our day to day processes that create positive change for our customers. That&rsquo;s why we put such a heavy focus on cross-team collaboration and innovation at ATB. We want to quickly identify problems and test out minimum viable solutions. It is that culture of innovation, and the willingness to embrace lean startup that will help us lead the way in business banking and be at the forefront of innovation in the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to transform day-to-day processes into impactful moments?

Many of us have experienced it - but at ATB this is the antithesis of what we strive for. Our over 5,000 team members across the province are highly skilled, talented, personable, creative, and genuinely enjoy their jobs. We know that each team member has an incredible amount to share with us, and they have game-changing ideas to bring to the table. The challenge is building an environment where those ideas can be sparked into action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where Innoventure comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innoventure is a 12-week program we developed in house to bring brilliant ideas to the surface. We weren&rsquo;t sure how many team members would jump on board, but right away we had response from so many diverse parts of ATB, we decided to start our journey with a nimble group of 20 of those team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one started off with an intro to Innoventure, the basics of creating business models and discovering a minimum viable product. We were inspired by lean startup methodology for our framework. Day two we hosted a collective brainstorming session&mdash;and together, we came up with over 100 ideas for ATB to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this round of Innoventure, we&rsquo;ve narrowed those 100 ideas down to four, focussing on opportunities that meet the needs of our clients. Our teams are now deep in research and business model development to prepare to pitch their ideas to an internal business panel for viability and execution. The ideas that made the cut focus on exciting opportunities like connecting our more than 80,000(!) entrepreneurs with one another, and building financial confidence of our customers, to name a couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to share more in-depth intel on the ideas that that make it through the pitch round, and then we&rsquo;ll move to step two: understanding the potential positive impact for our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of teammates throwing innovation at our customers and seeing what sticks&mdash;this is time and resources, passion and exploration, and maybe even some blood, sweat, and tears, all centred on listening to our clients and developing solutions to make banking, and life, better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for top talent to be part of programs just like Innoventure.

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions where real-world challenges are posted with training data and teams compete to create models that have high predictive performance. With over a half-million users, Kaggle is one of the largest and most active data science communities in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competitions are an entry place and training ground for some of the top talent in data science from across the globe. Competitors are ranked based on their models&rsquo; predictive capabilities on a separate test data set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you are going to participate in a Kaggle competition or know someone who is, here&rsquo;s what our talented team learned along their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 1: Communication is key</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the early stages of competition, you don&rsquo;t have to declare your team, but at the merge date, you must be within the total maximum of submissions (daily maximum X number of competition days) in order to merge team members. This means it is crucial to coordinate in advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 2: Implement version control for submissions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It&rsquo;s embarrassing to show up to a party with the exact same outfit as someone else, the same goes for submitting the same model as other members of your team. Make sure you coordinate submissions to ensure you won&rsquo;t have multiple team members submitting the same model. Dating and versioning submissions becomes even more important near the end of competition when you are looking at ensemble modeling and maximizing lift on high functioning models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 3: Say NO to procrastination. &nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nAlthough this is easier said than done, finding solutions to Kaggle problems requires creativity, experimentation, testing, and a lot of time waiting for models to run. So waiting until the last minute to start working means you may miss out on the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 4: Recognize the value of diversity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Having team members from diverse backgrounds, such as engineering, mathematics, and physics, can greatly increase your chances of discovering solutions that you would not have thought of alone. Each team member brings their own experiences, biases, and expertise, so having a diverse team is greatly beneficial when solving complex problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In fact, beyond the education/professional backgrounds, look at building a team with diversity in age, gender, and culture too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 5: Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day: spend time on feature engineering, especially for structured data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll increase your chances of model fit if you take the time to clean the dataset and explore feature engineering opportunities like testing for usefulness of individual features, combining related categories to allow for a more simplified predictive model, or constructing new features out of the raw data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">More features is not always better, and not all features are created equal. Feature engineering allows you to optimize and understand the input data, which should generally allow you to use more simplified models and improve performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 6: Diversity enables again! Domain knowledge is a benefit.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Speaking of feature engineering, having team members with domain knowledge and spending time to understand features can aid in feature engineering and predicting models. Look to build your team with intention and diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 7: Try black box solutions and ensemble modelling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">There are some great black box solutions for feature engineering. In a time sensitive competition environment, they are worth trying out. In real-life application, black box modelling is often limited to testing and validation, since understand why a model works is of critical importance. However in a Kaggle competition, testing models for incremental lift through any means necessary is what will take you up in the rankings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One of the top winning strategies for Kaggle competitions is ensemble modelling, which can provide a much needed incremental lift in the last stages of competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Ensemble modelling entails synthesizing the results from one or more models into a single score or spread. Again, in real-world application this often has negative effects on the explainability of a model, but in a Kaggle competition it is one of the top strategies of winning teams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 8: Do your homework.&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile we want to be a one-stop-shop for expertise, we know that no two competitions will ever be the same. So, look at winning strategies for similar competitions and check out as many forums as possible that provide learnings and tips for winning Kaggle competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 9: It takes a village - connect with the crowd.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Many people post open source solutions on Kaggle Kernels, it&rsquo;s there for you to be inspired, so don&rsquo;t miss out on this as a resource. Just don&rsquo;t make the mistake of copying models directly without thinking or making any changes or improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 10: Try training models with parallel computing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">You&rsquo;ll be pressed for time, so make sure to try high efficiency parallel computing models like XGboost or Light GBM.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Both models are gradient boosting methods and are the two best performing (both in speed and metric performance) machine learning algorithms for large datasets. Neither method is sensitive to over fitting, giving you the opportunity to use more features and to save time on feature engineering for large datasets without compromising performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Light GBM was the method used for the winning submission in the Kaggle competition that our team competed in. Compared to XGboost&rsquo;s level wise tree growth, Light GBM grows &lsquo;leaf wise,&rsquo; which means it reduces loss and is more accurate than XG boost. Light GBM uses a histogram based algorithm, which results in a faster training speed and higher efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Compute time is valuable when your team is testing hundreds of models. This is one of the reasons that techniques that are more efficient at finding high performance models are particularly useful in Kaggle competitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Tip 11: Even if you can&rsquo;t see it, it still exists!&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Think about the data that isn&rsquo;t staring you in the face! Even if your model works on the training data, it won&rsquo;t necessarily perform equally as well on the test data. Make sure you&rsquo;re building a model that will be effective on more than just the training data set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it, 11 tips extracted from ATB&rsquo;s very own Kagglers (they ranked 17th out of 231 teams from across the world, at one point in the competition, ranking 2nd place). Challenging ourselves and being intentional about testing and honing our skills is one of our favourite things to do at ATB. In your next Kaggle competition, take these learnings to keep pushing the limits of your capabilities in order to continue to serve those around you in innovative ways, just as our team does every day for Albertans.&nbsp;Are you interested in working with team members who are constantly hungry to learn more and improve their skills?

We&rsquo;re talking about things like ethics in artificial intelligence, bias in software development, and a need for design that is accessible and inclusive. Designers are creating online forms where people don&rsquo;t have to indicate a gender that they don&rsquo;t identify with. Inclusive design is incorporating different cultural perspectives and ways of speaking into voice activated apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, inclusive design brings us things like biometric identification to offer banking services to people who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have access. For us, inclusive design starts with how we build our teams. We practice what we preach - we want our team to practice inclusive design, so we use design thinking to build the team, culture, and workspace to achieve that outcome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in inclusive design is to set the intention and expectation that inclusivity will be built into every step of the process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we were intentional about building diversity into our teams. It is not only about ethnicity and gender, but also age, experience, beliefs, language, strengths, and weaknesses. On our design team, all team members have user design experience, but we have also hired for massively varied backgrounds and skill sets (creative, computer, product, content).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dedication to bringing diverse perspectives into the design process has led to a democratization of design at ATB. Instead of trying to own the design process, we practice transparency, openness, sharing, and radical collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our CX Research and Design Hub is an online portal where we openly share the work of the design team with our 5,300 team members. The processes, the data, the prototypes, the iterations, everything is open to see. Our goal is to contribute to the practice of design and design thinking across the organization, and ultimately, help everyone at ATB get closer to the customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anyone who influences how the design comes about is the designer.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collaborative focus feeds inclusive design across ATB. Our commitment to listen to Albertans stems from the desire to provide experiences and products that fit their needs. We&rsquo;ve taken a real stand about putting human beings at the centre of our business.&nbsp;<strong>Human Centered Design is inclusive by nature, and ATB is committed to making this part of what we&rsquo;re known for, part of our DNA.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no written code of ethics or code of conduct for the design and tech world. But as a profession, we aim to be in touch with the user and the human experience. As inclusiveness continues to be at the forefront of general discourse, designers can take the lead and make sure that inclusivity is built in to our processes and the products that we are putting out into the world. It starts with building teams and culture with inclusive design in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to a join a team full of changemakers that are passionate about making banking work for people...check out our open opportunities&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"08.02.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/045/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/045/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"building-teams-for-inclusive-design","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":20,"title":"Unstoppable ATB: the power of purpose, passion, and alignment","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/020/article_image.jpg","date":"23.10.2018 23:09","facets":["progress","connect"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"","description":"<p>Have you ever rowed a boat with other people?

Not just 22 paddlers pulling oars in the same boat, but 5000 Albertans all driven by the same mission and pulling in the same direction to transform banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How we are creating alignment across team members comes down to the communication of our expectations and creating a shared culture around what it means to be All In.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about the idea of being &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; at ATB for a number of years. Only recently, in fact just this last year, we created a simple and clear &nbsp;&ldquo;Team Member All In&rdquo; framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invest a lot of time to help team members really understand, connect and align with our culture and values. After about 100 days or so, our orientation program for new team members culminates in an &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; commitment call with our CEO and Chief People Officer. In the call we ask new team members to tell us what they honestly think about their ATB experience so far and to share their personal stories and commitment to being &lsquo;all-in.&rsquo; In fact, once in awhile a new team member tells us that they are not &lsquo;all-in&rsquo;. We really listen to their &lsquo;why&rsquo; and help them find their way: where they can best apply their passions and be &lsquo;all-in,&rsquo; wherever that may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All In isn&rsquo;t just a slogan with statements on the wall. We expect all team members to believe wholeheartedly in the 94 word story, to live the ATB values, and to give their best effort everyday to transform banking and use it as a medium to create happiness for Albertans. Responsibility is not passed on to colleagues, other teams, or leaders - it is up to every ATB team member to make the story come to life, everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our commitment is evident in surrounding team members with an awesome work environment and culture, being fully empowered to make changes, providing the best&nbsp;experience to customers, and taking risks to explore novel applications of technology in banking. We believe our team members and our leaders have the obligation and responsibility to become great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One area we&rsquo;re are particularly excited about is the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB AI Lab</a>&nbsp;in Spring 2018. We&rsquo;re currently recruiting a Managing Director who will help define ATB&rsquo;s enterprise AI strategy and the overall direction of the company&rsquo;s AI &amp; Machine Learning Lab.

So we empower team members to ask themselves, &lsquo;how might I need to change and grow to help the company change and grow?&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why have we formalized our commitment to be &lsquo;all-in?&rsquo; In our evolution, the All In framework brings together a lot of what we have been talking about for years - our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atb.com/about/Pages/our-story.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">story</a>, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atb.com/listen/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to listening</a>, and the ATB&rsquo;s (our guiding principles, including a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/atbfinancial/status/1010223624056270848\" target=\"_blank\">newly introduced 11th ATB</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power of aligning what it means to be &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; is inspiring. It all starts with making a personal connection&mdash;individuals matching their values and purpose with their work&mdash;and then aligning people working together towards a common aspiration in a way that reflects our values and mission as an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ATB is not a place for clock-punchers, ladder climbers, or spotlight stealers.

So in this alphaBeta content series we are exploring what it takes to be continuously innovative - what are the qualities needed? Is it something you are born with or can an innovative mindset be nurtured?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following up on Part 1, where we shared our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/24\">recipe for creating innovative ideas</a><a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cooking-up-innovation-part-1-a-recipe-for-success\">,</a> now we&rsquo;re dishing out some of our top lessons on the innate qualities of innovators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What qualities make an innovator?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate between nature and nurture as the foundation of an innovative mind, we&rsquo;ve found that it is a mixture of both that is crucial, with the common thread being an individual with a growth mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means someone with the ability to face failure and a level of comfort with ambiguity. Someone who is always willing to learn and change. Someone who can leave their mind open enough to make connections that others might miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of serving ATB customers with an open mind is the ability to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; beyond words. Whether we are conducting user tests for internal technology products or creating happiness through banking for ATB customers on the front lines,&nbsp;<strong>our ability to listen gives purpose to innovation. For any innovator, listening to the environment and people around you is a powerful guidepost. Listening ensures that you&rsquo;re chasing truly meaningful and impactful ideas, avoiding the pitfall of innovating for the sake of innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB, we are proud of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our team members. Just like there is no clear and defined path to become an innovator, there is no single set process to become a Transformer; but here are some of the innate qualities that we look for in our team members:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grit.</strong>&nbsp;Someone with grit is not afraid to roll up their sleeves and leave ego at the door, they work outside their comfort zone and regularly do things that are &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; their knowledge or ability, when it will create positive change for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Passion.&nbsp;</strong>Being driven by a bigger purpose brings a certain kind of energy that is not otherwise possible. ATB is driven by the mission to create happiness for Albertans through banking, that&rsquo;s what drives everything we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perseverance.&nbsp;</strong>Someone with perseverance has the ability to get back up when they get knocked down over and over (and over) again. When training your physical body or your mind, there are steep inclines and long plateaus. Perseverance means having the determination to power uphill through the difficult parts and the patience to continue when fighting through a plateau. Every time you feel a new challenge, know that if you stick it out one day you&rsquo;ll look back and think &lsquo;wow, when was I ever not an expert on this?&rsquo; It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get easier, but every time is less scary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many of the qualities of an innovator are inherent, there are also plenty of soft-skills that make the difference between having a creative idea and actually bringing that idea to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation = creativity + execution</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Communication and leadership skills will often make or break the ability of a creative person to execute on an idea.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will your crazy idea positively impact your organization? You must be able to listen without bias or judgement and communicate the vision to management to get buy in. You must inspire your team members in order to leverage their talents and successfully carry out your crazy idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So whether you&rsquo;re a natural born innovator, a creative-type building the soft-skills to turn ideas into reality, or a career minded individual looking to nurture your creative side - if you have grit, passion, perseverance, and the ability to truly listen, we&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ll get there.

There is no denying it. They run deep and have the potential to sabotage the design process, as we unknowingly build for ourselves rather than users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our practice here at ATB, we have built systems to safeguard the design process from the trap of our own bias. It starts with how we talk about our users. User is cold. Human is real. User is detached. Human is personal.&nbsp;<strong>So how do we build for&nbsp;<em>humans</em>, not&nbsp;<em>users</em>?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the heart of the human, we&rsquo;ve built in tests at each stage of our human centred design process to help us overcome our biases and put our &lsquo;human&rsquo; first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #1 - Have we talked with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; lately?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In phase one of the design process, we engage and discover. As designers, we need to empathize with our &lsquo;humans&rsquo; and immerse ourselves in their experiences. At ATB, this means sitting in on the call-center, working for a day in a branch, and interacting directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personas are a tool to make the customer more &lsquo;real&rsquo; - but what&rsquo;s even better is a real customer.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a busy work schedule full of meetings and deadlines, it can be hard to dedicate time to engage and immerse ourselves. It&rsquo;s amazing how often we don&rsquo;t just get out of chairs and engage with humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, we&rsquo;ve built it into our schedules.</strong>&nbsp;Instead of standing meetings for persona building in isolated meeting rooms, our CX team has scheduled out-of-office days to talk to the humans we&rsquo;re building for, and then we share learnings back with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #2 - Did we ask&nbsp;<em>the right&nbsp;</em>questions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now you&rsquo;re actually engaging with customers and asking questions, but getting to the heart of their needs also means asking the right questions. We&rsquo;re always trying to perfect the art of asking the right question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I asked you to draw a sunset right now, what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if I asked you to draw for me the most memorable sunset you&rsquo;ve experienced, now what would you draw?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions are also a really great way to uncover biases. Listen to ATB Managing Director of CX talk about the magic of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\"><strong>Questions from Kids</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a8dde09419202c783b598b0/1519246860394/QuestionsFromKids.mp3/original/QuestionsFromKids.mp3?download=true\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Test #3 - Did we validate&hellip;with humans?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve gone through the discovery phase and the prototyping phase, and now we are implementing a real product. We can&rsquo;t simply deliver the product and then pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next task. There is still work to be done validating that we&rsquo;ve really solved the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is crucial is bringing in the learnings from the discovery phase into the next phases of the design process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when redesigning the appointment booking process for ATB.com, one of our important observations in the discovery phase was that customers wanted more assurance that they are on the right track. They want to know if they are asking for the banking products, and that they can trust the person giving them advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we&rsquo;ve moved from discovery to the UX design, it can be easy to get lost in the usability and esthetic of the booking process. So we have to continually go back to the human we are designing for to make sure we are satisfying their core needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UX experience of booking an appointment online, this meant bringing forward this core theme of validation and assurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say an ATB customer, Allison wants to open an RESP, so she is booking an appointment online at ATB.com. Treating her like a human means that we should do more than let her pick a location and time, we should ask about her life. She is a new mom and is interested in saving for her kid&rsquo;s education. So, when her appointment is booked, we can tell her she&rsquo;ll be meeting with Angela, an ATB advisor with three kids of her own who has been in Alison&rsquo;s shoes. We can also be ready with other information about banking products and saving plans that fit her needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By building in validation through every step of the design process, we&rsquo;ve taken something that was quite transactional, scheduling a meeting online, and we&rsquo;ve made it much more personal. That is, human. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in applying human centred design to transform banking?&nbsp;Learn more about our open positions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"22.02.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/042/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"}],"labs":[]},{"id":41,"title":"Using predictive analytics for social impact: ATB competes in the Women in Data Science Datathon.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/041/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:46","facets":["progress","connect","technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>Sometimes the pressure and excitement of a team competition brings out the best in people. We know that our data scientists at ATB are amongst the brightest in the world, so when we have a chance to compete against some of the top teams, we don&rsquo;t think twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, four ATB team members competed in the Women in Datascience (WiDS) Datathon, predictive analytics challenge hosted by Kaggle and put on in a joint effort between the Institute for Computational &amp; Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University, Intuit, West Big Data Innovation Hub, and InterMedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition seeks to encourage teams (that must be 50 per cent women) to apply machine learning and statistical modeling in a predictive analytics challenge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this instance, teams were given a dataset with over 1200 features on demographics and behavior and were tasked with building a model to predict the gender of survey respondents. Read more about how the predictive models are intended to help design financial services for those excluded from the formal financial system:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional and mobile financial services. The dataset is a product of InterMedia&rsquo;s research to help the world&rsquo;s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system. By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>&mdash; WiDS Conference</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 231 teams made up of 512 competitors from across the world. Teams were provided a training data set, which comprised 16 per cent of the entire data. In preliminary submissions running models on the training data, ATB was ranked second amongst the 231 competing teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final rankings were tabulated when the predictive models were run on remainder of the dataset not used for training; ATB ultimately finished 17th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the thrill of a high pressure competition and the excitement of being ranked second leading up to the finish - there were important learnings that the team took away from the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After almost 80 models tested by team members, the final ATB submission was a weighted average of the top three models developed by the team - a real group effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beyond the team building and the excitement of getting ATB on the map within the world&rsquo;s largest machine learning community, the model and the techniques used to develop it could potentially be applied to other challenges.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though predicting binary gender is not an exact solution that ATB would be implementing, the challenge was fundamentally a classification problem. A similar predictive model could be used for predicting fraud, or other attributes that might help ATB team members provide optimal service to customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tackling the classification problem also gave ATB data scientists an excellent opportunity to test the machine learning technique of extreme gradient boosting on a real data set. This highlights an exciting outcome of participating in competitions: the opportunity to discover and use tools and techniques in the developing field of machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big shout out to the ATB WiDS team,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samiul-azam-59247b11b/\" target=\"_blank\">Samiul Azam</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukun-zhang-89283b35/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukun Zhang</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-akinwumi-phd-a68041147/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Akinwumi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunjan-k-b34b1513b/\" target=\"_blank\">Gunjan Kaur</a>.

She&mdash;or he, or it, depending on who you ask&mdash;has created quite a splash in the media for her charming personality.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey with Pepper has been an unexpected one thus far. We initially brought her onto the team expecting that she would be popular with Millennials, but the opposite has proven true; it&rsquo;s the older and younger generations who love her. They&rsquo;re happy with simple voice interaction and enchanted by her kindness and capability to recognize their facial expressions and answer questions. Millennials, on the other hand, expect more of Pepper&mdash;they want their sh*t figured out, and fast, but Pepper is no Siri. Yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, Pepper is in robot infancy. Her software determines her capabilities and limitations. Which is why we&rsquo;ve been testing, learning and continuously iterating Pepper&rsquo;s software on a rinse/repeat cycle. Sometimes the cycle requires new software to actually be developed before a new version of Pepper is ready to hit the streets&mdash;or ATB carpets, as it were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring the possibility of being able to have more fluid conversations with Pepper, during which she could assess customer needs and make swift recommendations. Ideally, she&rsquo;d remember customers from visit to visit in order to follow up with them. We&rsquo;d also like to find out how we can employ biometrics to make the customer experience even more personalized and helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s not going to take over the world (that would take some serious software), she&rsquo;s not even going to steal jobs from humans, which seems to be a common fear. The fact of the matter is Pepper can&rsquo;t replace the meaningful work humans do at ATB. What she can do is diminish &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work and help develop more relationships with our customers.

As ATB&rsquo;s first customer service robot, she has travelled around the province greeting ATB customers and Albertans in branches, showhomes, registry offices, and at university Welcome Weeks, trade shows, and other ATB-sponsored events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her job is to engage and delight customers and to complement the service that ATB team members provide. Through our proof of concept testing with Pepper, we&rsquo;ve gathered data and feedback from her interactions and gleaned incredible insights into how she can best serve ATB&rsquo;s current and future customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few of the things we&rsquo;ve learned from Pepper in her first year on the job:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>People expect her to be smart(er)</strong><br />\r\n\tMaybe we&rsquo;ve all been conditioned by movies that feature highly intelligent robots, but in reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, and natural language processing still have some pretty big limitations. We&rsquo;ve found that Pepper&rsquo;s human form means that people expect her to have human-like intelligence. Up to now, her interactions have all been programmed and she wasn&rsquo;t capable of free-form conversation. We are working hard to build her future capabilities as an intelligent robot that can educate our customers, complete tasks on their behalf, or connect them with our human team members.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She has the potential to break down barriers</strong><br />\r\n\tVoice technology is not comfortable for everyone. In many cases, people aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to interact with robots and with voice activated technology.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>People may not be quite ready to trust robots to do their banking, but in the meantime, we&rsquo;re gathering important learnings about what makes people comfortable and able to interact with Pepper. She is slowly building relationships and potentially helping us to bring new banking options to customers that might not otherwise be comfortable engaging with digital banking tools or machines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She likes strangers (and strangers like her!)</strong><br />\r\n\tOutside of the branch, Pepper&rsquo;s skills and personality were incredibly valuable. In our tests at showhomes, in registry offices, and on campus for student Welcome Weeks, Pepper provided concise and relevant information to potential new ATB customers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it is a challenge in branches to provide the complex service that our ATB team members excel at, when Pepper is programmed with information relevant to a narrow audience (like potential homeowners, business owners, or students), Pepper was much more capable of providing customer service and valuable information.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s not great at multitasking</strong><br />\r\n\tWe mentioned the limitations of the current state of natural language processing and voice technology. Two of the challenges Pepper faces are: not being able to speak and listen at the same time and difficulty processing multiple voices at once.&nbsp;\r\n\t<p>Taking this into account, loud locations with multiple speakers are not the most suitable work location for Pepper. We were able to narrow down the contexts to which Pepper is most suited and we&rsquo;re building experiences that shine in specific locations with a narrow audience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>First impressions matter</strong><br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve learned that it is crucial for Pepper to offer real value in a first interaction in order for people to be eager to talk with her again. So we&rsquo;re making sure she is in the right places at the right time with the artificial intelligence she needs to truly provide value to our customers. She captures the ATB core value of using banking to create happiness, but she is more than an entertainer, so we&rsquo;re ensuring she has the tools to make our customers&rsquo; lives easier.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>When Pepper debuted in ATB branches in Spring 2017, we didn&rsquo;t know how customers would react or what learnings we would find, but her first year on the job proved immensely valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice will play an increasingly important role in our future. At ATB we&rsquo;re excited about technology that will help reduce friction in banking. We can imagine a time soon when customers are driving to work and using a smart car audio system to transfer money, asking a smart TV to connect via video to a financial advisor, or asking a home voice assistant to pay the utility bills while they&rsquo;re doing the dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we&rsquo;re learning now from Pepper will help us optimize the user experience across voice-based channels.</strong>&nbsp;Pepper is just one channel of many, and she&rsquo;s the first generation of customer service robots that we can use to learn and improve how we serve our customers using technology in physical spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper&rsquo;s future is now splitting in two directions. She&rsquo;ll continue to be tested as brand ambassador for ATB at public events, embodying the friendly, helpful culture of ATB. Her second role will evolve as we continue to improve her natural language capabilities, perform tests with connecting her to internal systems, and introduce robotics processing automation to complete tasks for customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through it all, Pepper will continue to do what she does best:&nbsp;<strong>balance the digital future of banking with the friendly personal touch that ATB is known for.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in exploring the future of robotics process automation with colleagues like Pepper?

As part of that mission, we declared that we would become an agile development shop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve proven that it was more than just a statement. We&rsquo;ve changed how our teams work, we&rsquo;ve recruited top talent from around the globe, we&rsquo;ve put customers at the centre of our development processes. And we&rsquo;ve shipped some incredible products as a result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the journey so far, there has been massive uptake of agile development process across the pillars of our organization. But it is not something that is only relegated to the scrums and sprints of our software development teams.&nbsp;<strong>We&rsquo;ve proven that we can innovate processes - and now we&rsquo;re stepping back to bring some focus and coordination to take the agile mindset to the entire organization. &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In true agile style, we&rsquo;re testing and continuously adjusting our targets. One of the things that we&rsquo;ve learned in our journey is that&nbsp;<strong>a key component to success is a common understanding across teams of what agile means.</strong>&nbsp;Team members need the tools and frameworks, along with the skills and knowledge, to apply agile principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To increase the consistency across innovation pillars at ATB, we&rsquo;ve set out to make sure ATB team members have a common baseline understanding of agile. This starts off with a training program that we&rsquo;ve deployed through comprehensive online tools. Of course, we launched the training to a small test group, got feedback and adapted.&nbsp;<strong>With the help of agile champions, we&rsquo;ve now rolled out agile training paths tailored to each ATB Transformation team member.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we&rsquo;re tackling duplication across teams through onboarding and clear evaluation of initiatives; we&rsquo;re optimizing the size and composition of our squads and we&rsquo;re experimenting with agile planning on rolling schedules, reviewed quarterly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our slick new agile style doesn&rsquo;t mean it&#39;s all run-and-gun with no reporting - part of the structure is making sure we have accountability built in, but not at the expense of the speed. As we build agility across ATB, we&rsquo;ll be quicker at bringing together and disbanding project teams, allocating budgets, and shutting down projects as required. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working on bringing the agile mindset to ATB as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know we&rsquo;re on a trajectory to redefine how we do things here at ATB, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we know exactly where the journey will take us. Just like an agile software development team, our small team leading the agile movement at ATB is letting the client, ATB Team members, help define the end goal and the steps along the way. One thing we do know: we have a mission to transform banking and we&rsquo;re on our way there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you think you have what it takes to go agile?

It&rsquo;s been a key driver in e-commerce and the business world in general for years. But what does it mean for consumers? In fact, not many consumers would articulate that they want a &lsquo;seamless shopping experience across all online and physical shopping channels.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consistency is not necessarily what people are looking for. What they want is optichannel, where they can select the appropriate experience based on the channel they are in and the situational context.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of human centered approach that sets ATB apart in our approach to designing banking services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - you can optimize voice interaction for telephone banking, but when someone is on the train, they don&rsquo;t want to be reading out their bank card number. They want the option to have the experience that fits the channel they are using and the context they are in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans make these sorts of contextual decisions constantly throughout the day. Imagine an individual planning a family get together and needing to contact a grandmother, siblings, and parents. They are likely subconsciously picking the right time and the right channel through which to communicate with each person. A phone call to grandma, a text to the parents, and an email to a sister&rsquo;s work email to make sure she sees the message in time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re taking the same approach with banking services.&nbsp;<strong>It&#39;s more than providing the best voice experience, or a seamless switch from desktop to mobile. It&rsquo;s about knowing our customers and delivering what they need at the right time through channels and experiences that fit the situation and context.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The banking sector is not particularly well known for providing optimized customer-centric experiences. Partially due to legacy systems and siloed structures, it can be challenging for traditional banks to take the customer centric approach required to delivery exceptional optichannel experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where our<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/putting-humans-at-the-centre-of-cx\">&nbsp;human centric design approach&nbsp;</a>pays off.

This allows us to build experiences and processes based on the customer journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example - we&rsquo;re testing things like robotics process automation with our customer service robot,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/pepper-atb-balancing-the-digital-future-with-a-friendly-personal-touch\">Pepper.</a> Pepper currently provides banking information to prospective customers in person in showhomes and registry agencies, places where people need banking information but where live ATB team members are not available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re all about interacting on a human level. In a digital world, this means making sure that our online channels are as heartwarming and personal as speaking live with an ATB team member. Our customer-centric optichannel approach helps solidify ATB as Alberta&rsquo;s bank for digital and in person banking services that provides personalization and context appropriate experiences to our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you customer- centric just like we are?

This expectation not only applies to the banking industry, but also to industries such as retail and hospitality.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we transform the in-branch experience, we know that pooling our chips will help us leverage the collective knowledge of staff and customers to marry the ATB story with the experience of entering a branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that one of the most important parts of the transformation is to listen to the needs of Albertans. Part of this journey is a collaboration with ATB team members working in branches and co-creating directly with ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of transformation is much more than researching trends in other industries or undertaking customer surveys. We&rsquo;ve committed resources to the pre-work of understanding our network of physical spaces. This included a process of evaluating each branch, its role in the network, business performance, facility costs, space details, current customer experience, and important factors about the community that the branch serves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first step in the co-creation process is the data-driven evaluation of our branches as a network, rather than optimizing each location in isolation. We have hypotheses, but we won&rsquo;t know for sure until we&rsquo;ve heard it from our customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is where co-creation comes in. Our goal is to uncover the key insights about the customer journey, the defining moments, and how we can use our physical environments to enhance the customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we design the optimal branch experience, we&rsquo;ll be incorporating &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Service design - principles &amp; practices of team members in the branch. What skills and training they need and what behaviours deliver the experience customers desire.</li>\r\n\t<li>Environment design - physical space design that creates the desired atmosphere for customers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Technology design - tech that supports the experience - how are we leveraging technology for a superior branch experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the co-creation process, we&rsquo;ll be discovering the type of customer experience that we need to build into our branch design and the feelings that we want customers to walk away feeling after visiting an ATB branch. While we learn what the customer experience should be, here are a few things that we know it is not:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not the same as customer service.&nbsp;</strong>The &lsquo;experience&rsquo; portion is about understanding the touch points across the entire journey. How do we use the branches as a platform to discover more about our customers? How do we leverage in-person interactions to build trust faster and enable better service across all platforms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not high tech for the sake of being &lsquo;cool.&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>Tech should enable, save time, and build relationships. The tech solution itself is not the answer. For example, a customer might say that they find pulling out their driver&#39;s licence for identification clumsy and they would prefer biometrics - but what they want is more efficient authentication, whatever the technology implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a about designing aspects in isolation.&nbsp;</strong>It is rather the culmination of touchpoints across the customer journey. Reducing the friction in the journey. Form and function in our branches are complementary. Efficiency of space use is equally important to optimizing how customers move through the space. Sensory stimulation should be meaningful and pleasing, but may also achieve a desired outcome, like learning or reinforcing shared values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer experience is not a singular problem to be solved,&nbsp;</strong>but rather an iterative journey. That means that our branch design should be flexible enough to evolve over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet, but the path to get there is deeply rooted in customer experience and how we can use our branch locations to connect with our customers in ways that we haven&rsquo;t been able to before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, humans want to interact with humans. Though the ability to bank online and on-the-go is essential, we are betting on a future where physical branches are still a crucial part of our business. We are here to serve, and branches provide the enormous opportunity for ATB to build personal connections with our customers, discover more about their needs, and find the defining moments for each individual&rsquo;s financial journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CNzeFbV6cudvgTOkrVcByx4hghvSahm6BdLOViKbwg/edit?ts=5b1945b4\" target=\"_blank\">explore open opportunities</a>&nbsp;with ATB&rsquo;s Transformation team.</strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/026/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"co-creating-new-in-person-experiences","tags":[{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"},{"id":14,"title":"Digital"},{"id":7,"title":"Culture"}],"labs":[]},{"id":32,"title":"Community, colleagues, and culture at ATB.","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/032/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 21:05","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<p>We work in a special place.

And it is the culture at ATB that creates the kind of safe environment that is conducive to us achieving our bold plans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you build teams of people creating products, processes and experiences that drive happiness? It is crucial that we have strong leaders in software engineering, product management, and design, to name a few. The teams that we build are diverse, transformative, and purpose driven at their core.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately we are serving all of Alberta, a place that is rich with diversity and openness. In order to truly ensure that we design for our customers, we need to build teams that embrace and embody diversity of thought. We bring a lens of humanity and empathy to make sure that happiness is the end goal in developing new technologies and serving our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Campus life.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it like to work at ATB? It would be a change for us if things weren&rsquo;t changing. We plan weeks or months in advance, not years. Change is a norm here and something we embrace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our Calgary Campus, work goes beyond office walls. We have a Toastmasters club, composting lunch-and-learns, a summer farmer&rsquo;s market. It is so much more than X floor in Y office, it is really a campus life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of campus, Calgary is one of our best-kept-secrets. Not simply an energy and cowboy town, there are incredible technology companies, agencies, and organizations that are headquartered in Calgary. Not to mention a burgeoning AI community in the province, including our very own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AI Partnership</a>&nbsp;up the road in Edmonton with the University of Alberta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We get the best of both worlds - a metropolitan city, all the dining and nightlife you could ask for, and incredible career opportunities with reasonable commutes and an inspiring outdoor element to life. We are really a 365 day per year outdoor city. You can&rsquo;t resist the draw of bright, crisp winter days, the Rocky Mountains, and endless rivers, streams, and trails.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to attract incredible talent and diversity to our teams here at ATB.&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">we&rsquo;re hiring</a>!

But it&rsquo;s not as simple as setting a bot loose and seeing massive returns in time and money saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ATB we are very strategic in how we are rolling out robotic process automation. From how we decide which processes to tackle, to rolling out pilots, to tweaking and optimizing the processes themselves, we&rsquo;re putting great thought into how we can leverage robotic process automation to create better experiences for ATB customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our first priority is to identify where we can create the most value or solve the most pressing customer problem. With over three thousand internal and customer facing processes at ATB, we had to devise a strategy to evaluate and prioritize where to leverage automation. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star, our mission, of zero-disappointed customers, we started by documenting as many of our processes as possible to identify the right opportunities. This list of 1,700 process was then layered with factors like the risk level, process volume, complaint frequency, suitability for automation, and level of importance for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is a heat-map and listing of our internal processes by order of priority for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the processes that came out on top was customers making changes to their address on file. An occurrence that comes up frequency in the the lives of ATB customers. Internally, we have multiple systems in which an address change needs to occur, with plenty of downstream effects if there are delays or errors. For a customer, the request is straightforward: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve moved, I need to change my address.&rsquo; And, in the middle of a move, they have no time to spare and don&rsquo;t need any extra stress! This combination of factors makes address changes a prime candidate for a robotic process automation solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the other things that our process automation team does in our evaluation of processes is to take the lens of &lsquo;do we need to do this?&rsquo; and &lsquo;does this add value for the customer?&rsquo; We don&rsquo;t want to automate bad processes. We want to make necessary processes smarter, improve the business rules, and streamline the steps in a process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automation and process optimization are not new concepts. What is new today is the ease with which they can be applied and the broad use cases and scale of solutions. Where backend integrations usually require the accommodation of every possibility, robotics can isolate outliers that don&rsquo;t pass validation checks or adhere to business rules, breaking the &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; paradigm of automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we build our internal capabilities, the applications of drag-and-drop solutions and robots-as-a-service are enormous. Where connections with third party applications may be limited by permission to make changes or batch processes, robotics can allow us to connect even to external programs through APIs. Our early applications of robotic process automation are also scalable and adaptable to other business areas with little to no development work required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still early in our journey with automation. When we started, we used robotics software that mimics human actions. It basically automated the repetitive task of entering information. It picked up the request in one location and actioned it across multiple systems based on predetermined rules. For example, a staff member changes an address in a certain location and it activates an automated process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we added an app script to improve the user experience of initiating the request and remove the barrier of knowing in advance what form to fill out to activate the process. The third evolution is to layer on machine learning and natural language processing to allow for dynamic interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Robotic automation is what will ultimately bring the capacities of artificial intelligence and machine learning to customers. As the team progressively learns and improves, we are moving from local automation of one-off processes to creating end-to-end solutions. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are moving towards turning natural language inputs into structured data that results in action, rather than an information response. So you say &lsquo;I need to change my address&rsquo; and, instead of written instructions about where to go and what to do, a responding information request actions an automated backend process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re focussed on applying technology in areas that impact customers most. Robotics process automation applied to the right use-cases means better customer experience, and more time for us to hear our customers. Just one of the ways we are working every day to make banking better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you passionate about implementing technology to solve customer problems and improving customer experiences?

Outsourcing, automation, and quickly changing markets and technologies mean that the job market and the skills required to succeed are evolving quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our mission to become more than a bank, we are thinking about the jobs of the future, the types of employees that will lead in the future of work, and how ATB can be a place where those types of people can thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banking as we know it is on the brink of change. At ATB, we are building our capabilities and skill sets to be prepared for a new fast-paced world. And we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from individuals who are set for success with diverse knowledge and skills and the ability to quickly adapt when jobs are automated or required skill sets change.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of &lsquo;unicorn&rsquo; employees. Those magical creatures who seem to be capable of doing anything thrown at them, and doing it well. They are called unicorns because we&rsquo;ve heard stories of them, but often only second-hand&mdash;do they really exist? It is our prediction that these &lsquo;unicorns&rsquo; will become the norm: more of a swiss-army-workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The swiss-army-workforce knows how to acquire the tools required for whatever needs to be accomplished. Later in their careers, swiss-army-knife employees have extremely broad experience and skills&mdash;and they know how to draw on their broad knowledge, even in completely new roles or sectors. These team members are extremely compelling as an employer&mdash;what if you could have three people with the broad skill set of 10, or team members who can quickly acquire the skills to take on a new role. People who can adapt, switch, and be fluid between roles to bring things to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still need the experts who have deep domain expertise&mdash;but equally important are people who are able to switch directions. What about all those jobs that will be replaced with automation? A swiss-army-workforce can be fearless in the face of change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the quest to be ready for the future of banking, we are exploring our innovative mindset, as an organization and at the individual level.

That means we are able to overcome barriers to do things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/cracking-compliance-traditional-banking-for-unconventional-business-clients\">breaking into markets outside of traditional banking</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/going-agile-with-agility-the-road-to-organizational-agility\">constantly changing how we work internally.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another huge factor is the team. Innovation in banking won&rsquo;t come from the ideas of one individual&mdash;we&rsquo;re intentional about building a team full of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/building-teams-for-inclusive-design\">diverse thinkers</a>&nbsp;and different backgrounds. People who are bought into the the mission and values of continuous disruption and building a future of banking for the happiness of Albertans. We have great people, and trust in our team. That means that team members have autonomy to explore new ideas and are empowered to be bold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like disruption in the job market from technological change, banking is at high risk of major upheaval. We are striving to figure out our place in that future, which means we have to think beyond what we are and towards what we could become.

We serve it to others - watching, listening, and learning what gets positive responses and how we can make it better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming an innovator follows a similar path - we start by gathering information from thought leaders and experts, followed by narrowing down ideas to key sources of trustworthy information.

We are designing unique online and in-person experiences that are data-driven and real-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In contrast to bimodal models of application delivery, which combine the system of differentiation and innovation layers, the traditional Pace-layer model separates these layers, despite the similar use of agile development practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>For ATB, the systems of innovation layer</strong>&nbsp;is very much separate from the system of differentiation. It is the change engine of our work.

Through these changes, we have relied on some sparky individuals at ATB to help us manage the evolving landscape and ensure that we have a culture of adoption and agile development internally,&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;we scale out. After all, what good is convincing Albertans to adopt new solutions when our own team members aren&rsquo;t feeling it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of our work tends to be behind-the-scenes product development and internal process improvements...things that focus on our own team members. In the early stages of our journey we relied on traditional change management techniques and found that team member adoption was low with more efforts focused on workarounds and avoiding new tools and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Because traditional change management techniques were not aligning with our vision of an adoptive culture and an agile environment, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/need-more-spark-in-your-life\">Spark team</a>&nbsp;was assembled with key partnerships across our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams. Rather than traditional task lists and methodology, we&rsquo;ve blown up the typical notions of change management and taken on a lens that focuses on both adoption, and consequently, adaptation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spark team recognized the need to address multiple factors in fostering an adaptive organizational culture where team members rapidly adopt and become users of new solutions. They shifted the internal development process, stood up a dependency dashboard to keep project teams informed, improved user engagement with a methodology for surveying and interviewing, and changed our internal perceptions around failure and project termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This change in perception was crucial for success in fostering an adoptive (and adAptive) culture.&nbsp;</strong>But how does one actually target this shift within a large enterprise? We started by studying some of the most adaptive cultures in the world to uncover the features that they have in common. Here are a few of our top learnings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Adaptive cultures are constantly in flux</strong>, you have to practice to become good at change. Part of ATB&rsquo;s culture is to be comfortable being uncomfortable, this takes daily effort by each team member to step outside their comfort zone. It also takes commitment from our leadership team to be constantly adjusting targets and setting new goals.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Effective change is bottom-up, not top down.&nbsp;</strong>We have a community of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; at ATB, team members who have volunteered to be product testers and early adopters. Our goal is to eventually have the entire organization become igniters</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>It is human nature to act on what you&rsquo;re measured on.&nbsp;</strong>The Spark team celebrates and rewards our team of &lsquo;igniters&rsquo; who are instrumental in the deployment process, who act as advocates for a product and support fellow team members in the adoption process.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Widespread change requires momentum.&nbsp;</strong>There will always be an adoption curve, but our goal is to move the entire curve to the left, with greater emphasis on early adopters.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Working towards a culture of adoption, we also need to have the tools to measure success and ensure we put the user at the centre of all our efforts. In addition to user logs, the Spark team has implemented qualitative feedback loops and an internal net promoter score. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another way we are demonstrating our user-centric attitude is by integrating adoption activitie</strong><strong>s.</strong>&nbsp;We are not just measuring adaptiveness, but also taking the lead on things like roadshows, branch visits, and &lsquo;Spark hours&rsquo; to help our vast network of team members embrace what&rsquo;s new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our journey to transform ourselves, and banking, the Spark team is working collaboratively with our internal learning, communications, and marketing teams to create an adaptive group of people who are hungry for new things, rather than frustrated or annoyed with new rollouts. This takes two components: products that are needed, valuable, and based on user input - and people who are accustomed to change and are active in fostering a culture of adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in being part of a team culture with people who are eager to change and adapt?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our open opportunities here.</a></strong></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"13.06.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/025/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"fostering-a-culture-of-adoption","tags":[{"id":7,"title":"Culture"},{"id":10,"title":"Leadership"}],"labs":[]},{"id":59,"title":"Tech debt and digital transformation","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","date":"15.11.2018 22:14","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>In an era where every company is essentially a technology company, no organization can escape the challenge of dealing with technical debt.

The age of systems often corresponds with the level of vulnerabilities, particularly if those systems are no longer being patched or updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migrated largely from<a href=\"https://alphabeta.atb.com/article/reuse-buy-or-build-new-answers-to-old-questions-in-software-and-tech\"> buy vs build to build vs buy</a> in our digital transformation, a main focus is to get to 100% retirement of old systems. Just like financial debt, the compounding of interest on technical debt is cumulative, and we have to be careful to prioritize how we pay off our technical debt, consolidate into areas with the lowest risk, and make sure we get to 100% retirement of outstanding debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we prioritize paying off our technical debt? Just like how we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/optimizing-robotic-process-automation\">optimize</a> across all departments, we ask the questions: &lsquo;is the technology causing disappointed customers?&rsquo; or &lsquo;is it causing mistakes?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first priority is to provide the best banking experience to customers. Further layers of evaluation consider how the tech debt affects the availability, reliability, and security of our systems. Is this tool or technology needed? And what vulnerabilities does it introduce that could cause problems in how we deliver value to customers and team members? What is the minimum we need to do to get this into a supported state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way that we are constantly working to address tech debt is in the adoption of new technologies and tools. There are always great new products and ideas and technology is so accessible that teams can easily adopt new tools. But sometimes it results in even more money, time and investment to offset vulnerability or consolidate systems that can be properly supported. Our Tech Enablement department is the advocate for careful evaluation of new tools, like adopting a new customer relationship management tool. And most importantly, 100% decommissioning of old tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our cloud initiatives at ATB are a great opportunity for teams to leverage technology, giving team members access to the best machine learning tools, and making systems accessible across platforms and from any location. But we don&rsquo;t want to just move all the problems we&rsquo;ve had and all of the tech debt we&rsquo;ve accumulated into the cloud. We want to solve for the underlying problems simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Even within the cloud, we can look at the problem holistically, protect proprietary and customer data and make sure we are not accumulating unnecessary tech debt.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are strategic in how we tackle our tech debt. Just like consumers, we have have to manage our debt carefully, leverage it in places, make sure we are keeping careful track, and paying it down responsibly.</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"30.10.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_768_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/059/v_500_ATB-alphaBeta-Tech_Debt-FINAL.gif"},"slug":"tech-debt-and-digital-transformation","tags":[{"id":1,"title":"Innovation"},{"id":9,"title":"IT"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"},{"id":12,"title":"Customer Experience"}],"labs":[]},{"id":52,"title":"Need More Spark in Your Life?","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/052/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:10","facets":["progress"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"human","description":"<h2>So do we.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a general rule, a customer should never know more about a business than one of their customer services reps, but sometimes, sh*t happens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more jarring than accidentally telling someone about a new solution their company offers that even they aren&rsquo;t aware of. And we know it sucks for both sides of the conversation, which is why we always do our best to ensure that every member of the ATB team knows what&rsquo;s up. But the more our company grows, the more challenging it is to maintain the open and efficient lines of communication necessary for swift progress&mdash;and thorough adoption&mdash;to take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In exploring how to tackle this issues, we discovered we need more Spark in our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ATB Sparks are a team strategically assembled to bring together diverse backgrounds and experiences. Their focus? To inspire adoption and accelerate progress&mdash;in other words, to focus on &nbsp;ch@!^g3 management within our squads (yep, change management is a bad word for us!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of change over the years. 10 years ago, we weren&rsquo;t a digital company. In listening to our customers, we&rsquo;re moving from traditional, old-school bank to fintech, and that&rsquo;s left us with a lot of challenges on our hands. We straddle two completely different worlds, with completely different audiences, and we&rsquo;re always striving to honour our foundation while staying timely, efficient, and relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Sparks are deployed&mdash;each into a specific team&mdash;right at the beginning of a project, so that they can understand and maintain focus on the human side by connecting people with the new technologies we roll out on a consistent basis and helping our team members become advocates for transformation. They can also act on behalf of other members of our squads (e.g., learning, communications) so that they can stay focused on their work until a new project is absolutely ready for their input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re both proud and excited to be doing things differently here at ATB. We used to buy our solutions: now we build them. Moving away from a waterfall model and into agile project management has allowed us to get things done in 3-8 weeks instead of the 18 months they used to take. We&rsquo;re working with continuous feedback from our partners, and we&rsquo;re fully prepared to hear when something isn&rsquo;t working. At our size, we can iterate, kill a bad idea fast, and move on&mdash;something our competitors can&rsquo;t do. Sparks are a huge part of this forward motion, because when we make changes, they help those changes reach all 5300 of our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s in it for you? This isn&rsquo;t just a brag about our amazing team. What happens on the inside has an incredible impact on the outside of our company. When we make life smoother and more efficient for our team members, they have more time to return calls and emails, and truly engage with our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our biggest goal in creating the Sparks has been to eliminate information fatigue&mdash;to allow our team members the time and space they need to learn about what&rsquo;s coming down the pipe at ATB, adopt it, experience its value, and share it with you.

All the heads of the energy industry would meet in one location on the 25th of the month with their cheque books in tow, ready to settle their scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, as Oil Settlements become electronic, the process acquired new complexities requiring resources, such as reconciling and approvals involving countless humans manually entering in data and double checking contracts all the way along in advance of the big day. Both the energy companies and the banks&mdash;find the process to have become inefficient at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different companies use different internal systems for managing contracts, tracking finances, compliance, and so on. This meant that the entire process of paying out once a month involved people combing over different contracts, manually entering in agreements, and having to decipher one another&#39;s&rsquo; processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now enter blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRANSFORMATION THROUGH TRUST &amp; TRANSPARENCY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since early 2017, ATB and IBM together have built a proof of concept using blockchain that has the potential to make Oil Settlement Day a quick, frictionless and transparent experience for all members involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It no longer matters what internal programs and systems any company in the energy sector uses. It only matters that the agreed upon terms are defined in the blockchain. It provides a completely secure and private Blockchain system that all participants in the transaction, including energy companies, can access. Upon entering contracts into the Blockchain system, users will have universal and &quot;permissioned&quot; visibility of their own contracts within the system&rsquo;s ledgers, which means that when Oil Settlement Day rolls around on the 25th, the system can take care of all transactions almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No more manual money moving at ATB, no more clients staring at their bank accounts waiting for funds to arrive. Just slick transactions happening at a scheduled time but with more trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe the blockchain process will result in 80% of transactions being executed without error and human intervention (as compared to current state). The remaining 20% of transactional volume we anticipate will require &ldquo;human intervention&rdquo;. Even with this conservative estimate, blockchain will enable human capital resources to be optimally re-allocated elsewhere across the value chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to revolutionize such a traditional and large industry such as the oil patch means understanding how that industry&rsquo;s ecosystem works, and involving them in the design and prototyping process. We want the customers to be part of the solutioning so that adoption rates on the other side of the process are high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How ATB addresses solution development and ecosystem adoption is a key part of their journey on all products; as human-centred design is a key internal mandate. As such, working closely with the industry players that experience Oil Settlement Day to ensure they are a key part of the design process is important. This can range from interview to testing to design thinking workshop. People first. Technology next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops provided critical insights into the ecosystem; such as pain points and motivators; culture around priorities and decision making, and more. The conversations shed light on the reality of the vast stakeholders that are engaged in Oil Settlement Day and the need to ensure that a variety of industry players be consulted as part of the blockchain prototype - such as pipeline companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This deeper understanding of the ecosystem from the industry&rsquo;s perspective has now guided the steps to expand the needed participants for the MVP development and eventual piloting of the system. Plus, this collaborative process to date means ATB feels confident the Blockchain process it created can provide efficiencies to the energy sector not only in its backyard of Alberta, but across Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BUILDING MORE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past couple of years ATB has been on a journey to build its knowledge and understanding of the capabilities of blockchain, and along the way has managed to begin the development of what it believes will be impactful solutions beyond the oil and gas sector - such as solutions around payment and consumer digital identity. With each, they&rsquo;re engaging ecosystem participants early to help ensure velocity can be maintained as they scale these solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about ATB&rsquo;s approach to innovation, visit &amp; subscribe below!</p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"11.12.2018","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/065/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"atb-the-value-block-chain-engaging-in-inspired-solution","tags":[{"id":15,"title":"Blockchain"}],"labs":[]},{"id":54,"title":"How to Train Your Robot","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/054/article_image.jpg","date":"24.10.2018 22:12","facets":["technology"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<h2>Step one: think like a human</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB, our Bot Squad has been busy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly: we&rsquo;ve got a Bot Squad whose work is centred on training software robots to automate banking processes like payments, cash advances, and fee and interest reversals on ATB&rsquo;s Mastercard operations team. The first of those robots is Botson (named by an ATB team member in a contest&mdash;way to go, Myvan!) and we&rsquo;ve just closed in on the end of Phase 1 of training and exploration with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Pepper, Botson is a software robot, which means it doesn&rsquo;t embody a physical robotic form (no labcoat-wearing scientists chasing after a robot with clipboards and stopwatches here!). This type of software is referred to as robotic because it&rsquo;s malleable and can be trained, which is where the Bot Squad comes in. And interestingly, a lot of the training process has us thinking more like humans than robots&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, we initially thought we could train our robot by sitting down, recording the steps necessary to complete a task and then loading them into the robot&rsquo;s software and walking away. What we quickly realized is that completing multiple tasks throughout a day takes a lot more than the basic steps. Because every time a new task arises, it can bring with it a unique set of circumstances. So what Botson needs to be trained on are the exceptions to rules, the &quot;what ifs&quot; and the analysis of multiple outcomes that can be required for a single transaction. In other words, the critical thinking skills our human team members possess in droves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this means is that we need the experts on hand to train Botson&mdash;team members who know the work better than anyone else&mdash;who can quickly identify exceptions that may come up and who can call a spade a spade when it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a robot to complete a certain task. When the robot is suited for a task, it needs to be broken down into small, logical pieces; robots work very well in situations where high volume, short task processes need to be completed. They also do well with highly structured data, and with moving data between systems. Where they need some help is in the more human realm of critical analysis and situational decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucky for us, we have an amazing team of humans to do the human work, so our main goal with robots like Botson is to offload repetitive tasks to the bots to free up time for our highly skilled employees to learn more, innovate, and foster relationships with our clients across Alberta.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience thus far with Botson has taught us a lot about how to train a robot. Here are our top three takeaways, should you be planning on training a robot of your own in the near future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about today and tomorrow, and the &ldquo;why?&rdquo; - It&rsquo;s not just about solving today&rsquo;s problems in the realm of robot training. It&rsquo;s also about getting critical about today&rsquo;s problem-solving and how it can be improved, and also about looking forward to what may need solving in the future.<br />\r\nPut on your pessimism hat - Just kidding (mostly). When training a robot, you do need to consider all the ways a task or process can go wrong, however, so that you can them how to deal with all possible outcomes. Spread the love - Once you&rsquo;ve got a robot trained to complete certain tasks, it&rsquo;s helpful to think about other contexts those problem-solving skills could work within. Think about this like getting more robotic bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of all of this is that it&rsquo;s just the beginning. We&rsquo;ve got Botson completing a couple types of tasks, but as we train and iterate its processes, we&rsquo;re already envisioning the significant possibilities of this work, and the significant possibilities it will open up for our human teams to explore, grow and excel.

At ATB, we&rsquo;ve been working with facial recognition&mdash;and other biometric tokens&mdash;to explore the various contexts in which they can offer truly effective and efficient solutions for our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any sort of biometric identification, one of the first questions we hear consistently is about whether or not someone could &ldquo;steal&rdquo; your face and use a photo to trick the system and walk away with all the money in your bank account. The quick answer is no, they couldn&rsquo;t, for a few different reasons. A flat image can&rsquo;t just stand in for a real human face, because facial recognition works by projecting a bitmap onto a user&rsquo;s face to detect various ridges and features. It also bounces random light&mdash;invisible to the human eye&mdash;off its subject to detect things like head movement and identify edges on a photo or phone screen that may be present. The only exception is identical twins, so if you&rsquo;ve got a sibling rivalry going on, you&rsquo;re going to want to take extra precautions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the technology being virtually impossible to fool, it&rsquo;s important to remember that your biometric tokens are saved on your smartphone or other mobile device&mdash;and not in some random third party database. So in order for someone to steal your money using facial recognition, for example, they would need to have your account info, your device, and your biometrics. So in other words, you&rsquo;re probably much more likely to get eaten by a shark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we did our biometric testing, we found that touch ID provided the most frictionless experience, following by facial recognition and voice ID. 67% of the people we asked said they would use touch ID, with only 14% saying they would use facial recognition, but it will be very interesting to see how these numbers shift and change the more smartphones and devices start to utilize facial recognition and the more it becomes a part of everyday life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already been testing the use of cameras equipped with facial recognition in some our branches, to explore how we could make our customers&rsquo; experiences even smoother. It&rsquo;s just as much work to pull out your debit card as it is to pull out your smartphone to scan your fingerprint&mdash;these cameras could eliminate the need for either. We ultimately would like to be able to recognize customers as they walk into any of our branches so we can have their account info queued up and we&rsquo;re ready to help the moment they approach our desk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also be supporting facial recognition on our mobile banking app, which, surprisingly, is an incredibly quick and easy system to integrate. On our end, it&rsquo;s essentially a flip of a switch before we&rsquo;re ready to accept facial recognition. The actual wait, of course, will be for all smartphones to integrate facial recognition technology. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll soon be ready for anyone already using it. We&rsquo;re really excited to see what adoption rates and variety of uses will be like moving forward, and we&rsquo;re ready to support, learn, and iterate our own technologies and processes to develop the best solutions possible to make ATB customers&rsquo; lives better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for top talent to work on innovative projects just like this one.

It can also be hard to share information on the internet if you can&rsquo;t trust where it&rsquo;s going to end up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We told you a little bit about blockchain technology and the potential for<a href=\"http://ttps://atbalphabeta.com/articles/71\">&nbsp;identity records,</a> but how can people and organizations actually start using these innovations in real life? It starts with a network, and ATB has been exploring one such network as the first Canadian steward of Sovrin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin is a blockchain network that works by acting as the &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; between facts&mdash;they accept facts about people or places, as well as the verification from another authorized party that those facts are true and trustworthy. For example, in the future, when we all have digital identity records, you could add your new driver&rsquo;s license to your records through Sovrin, and the Government of Alberta could verify that it is, in fact, a real and valid license. From there, you could use your identity record anywhere you need to present ID with the simple scan of a QR code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the fact that this process would be highly efficient and completely trustworthy, it also adds a new level of security to our lives. Consider the number of times you&rsquo;ve had to present your ID just to prove that you&rsquo;re over 18. The person verifying your age, in the process of doing so, has also had access to your full date of birth, your address, your height and weight, etc. Using an identity record would allow a third party to scan a QR code and know&mdash;without doubt&mdash;that you are over 18, without learning anything else about you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refreshing, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why have we become a steward of Sovrin, and what does that actually mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sovrin was founded by Evernym, who quickly realized that in order to truly operate a network of trust, Sovrin needed to be a non-profit organization, separate from any for-profit company. As a foundation with a diverse board of trustees, Sovrin can and does now exist and function without its founding company, and all servers and software required to run the network are provided by stewards for no fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud to be the first Canadian steward, and it&rsquo;s our goal to be the first bank in North America to offer our customers digital identity records. Of course, there are many challenges associated with that goal. As leaders in innovation, ATB gets involved in these sorts of explorations very early on. Sovrin may not be the end all, be all solution, but it&rsquo;s a strong solution and it&rsquo;s allowing us to move forward, which is the direction we&rsquo;re always looking to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being innovators often also presents the challenge of working in a space without a lot of groundwork or foundation. How do we introduce digital identity records to the mass market? How do we ensure our customers feel comfortable and eager to adopt them? And how to we encourage and foster other companies and organizations to start working with digital wallets and a blockchain network? We&rsquo;ve taken all of these questions and thrown them into our sandbox environment, where we&rsquo;re doing a lot of internal testing. We expect this project to go through countless iterations throughout 2018 so that we can make sure the many complexities of the system are dealt with and fully understood before we roll it out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for great people to join us on our journey.

We&rsquo;re also eagerly sharing new tools and technologies with ATB customers through MVP launches, beta tests, and new business lines. And, lucky for us, many of our customers just can&rsquo;t get enough!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core changes in how we do business differently came from a shift in our internal mindset. Adopting a customer obsession and talking to customers about their needs and wants and how they currently use banking tools. For financial institutions, this is a different way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than just a few new rules, we&rsquo;re now playing a fundamentally different game. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our customer obsession, we gathered the team of innovative thinkers and the technology stack to enable us to design and prototype tools to meet those customer needs.

We know we have to work constantly to create a state of comfort for our customers and to maintain confidence in our systems and the changes that we make. That means allowing customers to consume just enough to understand. Giving customers control over their experience and assuring them that what they do everyday will still work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, updating a customer tool or the look and feel of an online business banking platform would have had a launch date, with communication plans for educating team members and customers that a new tool was launching. Inevitably, on launch day, customers still feel like it is a change that is done<em> *to* </em>them, and not *<em>for* </em>them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are turning that process around and putting value first. What are people actually doing and how can we make small improvements that will make their life better? By sharing our MVP with groups of customers early and iterating along the path, we actually get to the end stage with a better outcome and also with more value for customers over all. We fix problems when they are at a smaller scale, with 100 or 1,000 users instead of a full launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because online banking tools are key in managing money, we need to make sure customers involved in this journey are confident that we aren&rsquo;t negatively disrupting their process for changes that we can&rsquo;t bring to life rapidly. A key to keeping the confidence of customers in the early testing phase is to give them confidence that it is secure and stable, that they can&rsquo;t break anything, do anything accidentally, or &lsquo;make a mistake.&rsquo; Importantly, the tools we&rsquo;re testing must also have value for them to try it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms - we start off at a very small scale. Our first testers are generally customers who have expressed a specific need. And the testing happens with live systems, not demos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is no alternative to a real experience for a customer with their live account information and actually satisfying a need or completing a task.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We empower our customer to decide what experience they will have. Importantly, they have the option to go back to the old experience. There is no down side for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small steps, user-centred design, and putting customers in charge of their own experience; that is how we are building a base of ATB customers who are willing to change and grow along with us. Avid supporters and enthusiastic beta users. Customers with the same adoption mindset as ATB team members. We may be playing a new game, but our teamwork is stronger than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you an ATB customer interested in beta testing new products?

Although more than 60 thousand people work in the arts and cultural sectors of Alberta (generating over five billion dollars a year), the industry is competitive, cash flows erratic and dreams underfunded. Plus, that &ldquo;break the mould&rdquo; approach to creativity isn&rsquo;t always an understood mindset when it comes to banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than ask artists to conform to a bank&rsquo;s view of an ideal customer, banking needs to catch up, step up, and meet the unique needs of artists‒for the greater good of all Albertans. Which is exactly why we&rsquo;re taking a fresh artists-first approach to banking with the ATB Branch for Arts and Culture (or, &quot;The Branch&quot;), launching in Calgary and Edmonton late November.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch will be unlike any other location we&rsquo;ve opened. In fact, you could say we&rsquo;re focused on making it as un-banky as possible&mdash;c&rsquo;mon, not all of us at ATB are &quot;left-brained&quot;. The Branch for Arts and Culture is built by artists (that happen to be expert bankers), for artists. The team working at The Branch are artists themselves, who intimately understand what it&rsquo;s like to live and work creatively, and who will be focused on offering a range of solutions to clients with a range of not-so-typical income streams. Beyond providing customized financial services, The Branch hints at a future as an arts venue, morphing into anything from a concert site to a gallery space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch staff has been talking and listening to artists and creatives to truly understand how we can provide as much support as possible. From workshops for those who need more guidance in their grant applications to a variety of different lending models to connecting our customers with Blue Cross, we know that financial confidence and planning is not as prominent in the arts world as it is in others, and we&rsquo;re on our way to changing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that note, our left brains are already at work helping artists access ATB&rsquo;s alternative financing solutions, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atbboostr.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">ATB BoostR</a>. Our crowdfunding platform allows the village to get directly involved in the journey of a local artist, and also, as a great side benefit, helps us develop new lending and credit models that reflect the lives of creatives. Imagine lending models that include a wider view of credit indicators and take creativity, community and commitment into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that creative-preneurs are important beyond their creative sphere. They&rsquo;re innovators. They help bring about significant economic diversification and can spark big changes to communities by fostering and building a pool of top talent, which leads to catching the eye of top employers, new HQs moving in, and a whole heck of a lot of growth. For us, it&rsquo;s also about putting our money where our mouth is: when we say we&rsquo;re on a mission to transform banking and help all types of entrepreneurs amplify their business, we mean it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCheck out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atb.com/thebranch\" target=\"_blank\">www.atb.com/thebranch</a>&nbsp;for more details.

Banks in other countries are further along.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A look at some of the deployments in three of them &mdash; Israel, Canada and Hong Kong &mdash; could offer ideas and inspiration for those in the early stages, as well as insight into what is working and what is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few takeaways: Bots are not just for millennials, document scanning can be the hardest part, and people are more comfortable asking questions of bots than they are of humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Israel</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bank Leumi officially launched the AI-powered, mobile-only bank Pepper in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial intelligence lets Pepper provide what CEO Lilach Bar-David calls &ldquo;contextual intelligence.&rdquo; The AI engine analyzes customers&rsquo; transactions, what they are clicking on, how long they stay on specific data elements, and other data points to determine what should appear in each customer&rsquo;s app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes real-time, daily, weekly and monthly spending alerts and customized content including news articles and consumer tips based on the AI engine&rsquo;s growing understanding of what the customer does, wants and responds well to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It takes time &mdash; the more you transact with us, the more we know about you and the more we leverage that data to give you personalized banking,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;So my Pepper and yours won&rsquo;t look the same because the feed will be based on our personal behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper warns customers of potential problems &mdash; for example, if a customer continues to spend at his or her current rate, that customer will have a negative checking account balance by the end of the month. It might also tell the customer it&rsquo;s OK to draw from savings to avoid that negative balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper will eventually be three apps that can be used alone or together, linked with a single sign-on. The Pepper banking app provides access to checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and loans. Pepper Pay, launched in February, allows person-to-person payments. And an investment app is due to launch by early next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, a few hundred thousand users have downloaded the Pepper banking and Pepper Pay apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to help customers better manage their money. The bank conducted several surveys of the &ldquo;global millennials&rdquo; it targets with Pepper and found they were less concerned about fees because they don&rsquo;t know how much they pay anyway, but struggled with lack of knowledge about banking in general and how to develop good personal finance habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early adopters are not who Bank Leumi thought they would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were under the assumption that only millennials would get on board Pepper, but actually, more than half its users are consumers aged 35 and above,&rdquo; Bar-David said. &ldquo;It makes me think we&rsquo;re reaching people with millennials&rsquo; state of mind more than an age.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is developing 24/7 human customer service for all three apps over voice, video and chat. When the customer starts a call or chat, agents will know who the customer is and what they have been doing; the AI engine will try to predict their questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, customers really like the video chat; they use it to help them navigate the eight-minute sign-up process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest part of onboarding, Bar-David said, has been having the app read information from the ID documents correctly in Hebrew. The workaround is to let people take pictures of their IDs and then type in the details from their phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because design is important &mdash; &ldquo;When they join a bank that&rsquo;s only mobile, consumers compare you to Facebook, Google; the expectations are sky high,&rdquo; Bar-David said &mdash; the bank hired 150 employees, many from tech startups, to create the mobile apps. It worked with the strategy design firm Designit on the apps&rsquo; look and feel, including a custom-made font. The core is Temenos&rsquo; software, selected for its affordability so Bank Leumi can pass those lower costs on to customers, Bar-David said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepper is being given time before it is required to produce a return on an investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;On the one hand, it&rsquo;s a strategic move for Leumi,&rdquo; Bar-David explained. &ldquo;They did it because they believe disruption is needed and consumers expect a dramatically better experience in the banking industry. On the other hand, we didn&rsquo;t build a bank for fun. It has to be in the end a bank that&rsquo;s profitable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Canada, RBC launched a Personetics-based virtual assistant including financial guidance and automated savings features in September. TD Bank embedded an AI chatbot that uses Kasisto&rsquo;s Kai software in its mobile banking app in early October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another large Canadian regional bank, ATB Financial, launched an AI virtual assistant for Facebook Messenger using Finn.ai&rsquo;s technology in late October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comfort factor</strong><br />\r\nPeople are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being, says Wellington Holbrook of ATB Financial in Canada. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook he says.<br />\r\nThough other banks, including Wells Fargo, Citi and TD Ameritrade, have Facebook Messenger bots, ATB says it is the first in the world to offer full-featured banking through Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always thinking of new ways to creatively compete with much larger competitors: How do we bring better service to our customers, how do we compete on scale?&rdquo; said Wellington Holbrook, chief transformation officer at the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For financial institutions like ours, [a virtual assistant is] a bit of an evening of the playing field,&rdquo; Holbrook said. &ldquo;When you consider the complexity of bringing a lot of different services to our customers through traditional channels, it&rsquo;s very people intensive, very cost intensive, and we&rsquo;re at a disadvantage in terms of our relative size. The virtual assistant is an equalizer for us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year ago, Jake Tyler, CEO of Finn.ai, and his team approached Holbrook to suggest ways the bank could provide more modern experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The virtual assistant creates a departure from the traditional ways of thinking about banking, to a much more modern way of thinking that has more in common with the way you interact with other types of organizations or your peer groups as a consumer,&rdquo; Tyler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This increasingly means providing banking services through third-party platforms like Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finn.ai, Tyler said, lets people do about 80% of their banking activities in a Facebook Messenger bot. Customers can pay bills, pay friends and transfer money between accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time that full featured functionality has been available&quot; within Facebook Messenger, Tyler said. &ldquo;We thought it was important to do core banking activity for customers as the foundation for an assistant that will be useful to them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a spending insight feature of which customers can ask questions like, &ldquo;What did I spend at Starbucks?&rdquo; or &ldquo;When is my Mastercard bill due?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATB and Finn.ai are working to make the bot more helpful, so beyond telling customers when their bills are due, the bot might make sure they have enough money in their accounts to pay them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any question the bot cannot answer gets passed to human agents at ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In testing the virtual assistant, Holbrook observed the same thing Darrius Jones has noticed in USAA&rsquo;s use of Clinc&rsquo;s AI-based Amazon Alexa Skill: People are willing to ask a virtual assistant questions they feel uncomfortable asking another human being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fear of being judged,&rdquo; Holbrook said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holbrook&rsquo;s biggest aspiration for the bot is to make it easier for customers to bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The banking industry has been focused for a long time on driving efficiencies, making banking work better for us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the revolution of smart devices, we haven&rsquo;t kept up with making experiences better for our customers. We see this as the beginning of ways we&rsquo;re going to use tech to help customers make more out of their time, and create more happiness in their lives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Hong Kong</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest noteworthy announcement of a customer-facing AI implementation is Standard Chartered Bank, which is based in London but has a presence in 68 countries. In mid-November, the company said it planned to deploy a chatbot on its online and mobile banking platforms using Kasisto&#39;s conversational artificial intelligence platform, KAI Banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chatbot will help clients manage money, make payments and analyze their spending via natural conversations in English and other languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to take the bot live first in Hong Kong next year in English (subject to regulatory approval), then gradually deploy worldwide in multiple languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is not ready to talk about the technology yet, but Zor Gorelov, Kasisto&#39;s CEO, said his company is teaching KAI Banking about Hong Kong regulatory rules and banking practices, as well as about Standard Chartered products to prepare for the rollout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is also teaching the software to speak &ldquo;Chinglish&rdquo; in text and voice communications: Sometimes people will start a sentence in one language and finish it in another, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai already understands much of the banking terminology used in different parts of the world, Gorelov said. For instance, it knows that &ldquo;current account,&rdquo; &ldquo;CA&rdquo; and &ldquo;checking account&rdquo; all mean the same thing. It knows that &ldquo;FD,&rdquo; &ldquo;fixed deposit&rdquo; and &ldquo;certificate of deposit&rdquo; are different ways of describing the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re learning everyday here at ATB and looking for insights anywhere we can.

We must evaluate risk and analyze how suitable a process is for automation - this requires human judgement, reasoning, and compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But yet, there are plenty of processes that are ripe for automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At ATB, we&rsquo;re not afraid of working alongside automation, because we know how much value our (human) team members provide to each other and to customers. Our team members offer, through judgment, the ability to listen and engage - things our bots or any AI we implement just can&rsquo;t provide. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we evaluate and implement intelligent process automation, we use a customer focussed lens to identify and prioritize projects. By focusing on customers, we&rsquo;ve identified over 50 processes to tackle through a combination of streamlining and end-to-end intelligent automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal: to disrupt the customer experience and reduce manual work required by team members, allowing them to focus on the value of human interaction (and eliminating potential for common human faults, such as typos or inconsistencies in data entry). By leaning into intelligent process automation technology, we get to continually live up to our tagline &ldquo;Banking Made Simple.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automation means that we can: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Reduce risk</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Think of a simple form of automation: automatic vehicle lights. For decades, a human had to turn on the lights when it got dark. Automation removes the human factor of this clear binary decision. When the sensor detects dim light, a switch flips and the headlights turn on - no possibility for human error, and reduced risk of accidents due to impaired visibility on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Similarly, processes like account suspension based on fraudulent activity benefit greatly from the combination of high-powered real-time data monitoring. Automation then carries out tasks between different internal systems based on data inputs and structured rules.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Even updating customer information such as addresses can be a tedious task because team members must go into numerous different systems depending on the products that the customer has with ATB. Process automation, combined with data validation on the inputs, eliminates the risk of errors and reduces overall manual work for our team members so they can work on what they do best.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Work smarter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>As a human race, we&rsquo;ve levelled up in terms of our intelligence and achievements. We&rsquo;ve historically used tools to augment our abilities, and now computing power and technology have put information at our fingertips. We&rsquo;ve moved from needing to know <em>how to do</em> math to needing to know <em>how to use</em> a calculator to input your problem, for example. Now, we are taking this one step further and moving into a stage where a computer can actually identify both the problem and the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>ATB is an organization that offers a diverse set of products and services. Therefore, we have a lot of systems and processes in place that don&rsquo;t always talk to each other. What robotic process automation allows us to do is create value for our customers by enabling the connection of all of these processes. Problem &rarr; Solution.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Save money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Working more efficiently is always a key priority in business. Anywhere that we can streamline process and improve how we work provides value to our customers and stakeholders. Thus, robotic process automation allows us to streamline process without investing in new systems and means we can service our clients faster.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>We are also living in an interesting time where technology has become more democratized. Computing power is not only increasing at an exponential rate. That power is also becoming accessible at a much lower price point. Improvements to hardware and the rise of cloud computing make it possible for any organization to employ better technology at a lower investment than ever before.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Provide more value</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much opportunity to augment human knowledge and decision-making by leveraging technology in banking. We can be smarter about giving advice to customers, and about fulfilling customer requests. We can move information faster and more seamlessly. Rather than aiming for 100% automated processes, we are working toward 100% value-added work from our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining the power of technology and the skills of our team members enables us to enhance the ATB experience. Whether you prefer to find answers to your banking questions on your own or by speaking with one of our team members, process automation and technologies such as artificial intelligence allow us to deliver a great customer experience every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to robotics software, we leverage enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing to optimize our processes end-to-end. AI can help us better capture what the customer needs (but not feel like they are interacting with a robot), and from there, robotic process automation can execute the process to fulfill their request. Eventually, machine learning and using robots as a service will allow us to build on these solutions and integrate more of our core processes or third-party applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s so magical about process automation is its ability to drastically change the customer experience without huge investment in back-end systems.

People who are capable of abstraction, who know the business areas intricately, who know the customer really well, who can see the whole picture, and those who understand the small individual pieces are all essential for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, experienced software developers bring to the table rigorous methodology in model management, documentation, quality testing, and sound development practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful AI and machine learning teams need a mix of people from diverse backgrounds with theoretical knowledge, research skills, data science mastery, and strong development expertise to piece together the puzzle of applied AI and machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, as Edmonton and Alberta move towards being a global centre for AI, there is so much support, funding, and interest flocking to Alberta now. We are really strong in this domain already and it is only going to grow as great minds flock to the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For academics and those studying advanced degrees in technical areas or for those who have made the career transition to apply their expertise to AI and machine learning already here are a few pieces of advice:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Be informed about the world at large - it gives you ideas of how to apply novel ideas in your context. <strong>Go beyond theoretical applications to make the connection with the real world.</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Find a sub-domain in your area that you want to become the best at and keep your focus narrow. </strong>Don&rsquo;t try to be an expert in all things - know your limitations and have deep understanding in your speciality, awareness of what you don&rsquo;t know, and an open mind to how your expertise can apply to other topics. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Keep the curiosity going, get comfortable being uncomfortable and exploring outside your expertise area.</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at ATB and across the AI and machine learning ecosystem in Alberta, we need to be bold and own the knowledge and expertise that we have and to own the solutions to demonstrate to the world the good that can be done with AI and machine learning. We are looking to bring together experts from across fields to create novel solutions and leverage the power of AI for the good of Albertans and the world.

You walk into your neighbourhood ATB where you&rsquo;re greeted by Pepper the robot. She scans your fingerprint and you tell her you&rsquo;re ready to get your first mortgage. She directs you to a customer experience rep whose computer&mdash;based on your fingerprint and vocal recognition&mdash;has already pulled up your identity record, complete with a recent photo, address, credit history and biometric tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting you up with your mortgage is quick and frictionless&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need for long approval processes and credit checks. This identity record is stamped with the date it was created, and also contains a list of notes and additions you&rsquo;ve made to it since birth. Everywhere you go, you&rsquo;re able to securely update this identity record, and every time you do, your new information is instantly passed on to the organizations you&rsquo;ve authorized to see it. Your identity, belongs to you, and only you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t some lofty dream of the year 3000. It&rsquo;s a dream we have of the not-so-distant future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re probably familiar with blockchain as the technological backbone to Bitcoin. The name is self-explanatory once you understand how the technology works. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin blockchain groups all transactions that have taken place during that time frame, puts them through an algorithm, and adds that group&mdash;or block&mdash;to a chain of other transaction blocks. Each block in the chain refers to the previous block, which refers to the previous block, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes blockchain technology so appealing is its level of security. Blockchain&rsquo;s algorithms are incredibly difficult to hack, and with Bitcoin you only have a 10-minute window in which to try. After that point, a new block of transactions is created and you can&rsquo;t change a single block without the waterfall effect of the system being completely broken down. You would have to communicate your hacked block changes to every single computer in the Bitcoin network. With a distributed leger system in place (i.e., copies of transactions existing on thousands of computers), it would be essentially impossible to communicate that quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, in many ways, blockchain systems like the one developed for Bitcoin may seem like the last place banks would want to get involved, because the system itself diminishes the need for an intermediary (i.e., a bank) to be present for security reasons. The trust required to complete a transaction securely is built into the system&mdash;the system&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the trust provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we&rsquo;ve found in blockchain systems, however, is not a fear of our own demise, but significant opportunities to make our customers&rsquo; lives better in so many ways, starting with banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of last year, we sent money from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BMxnHQGy4\" target=\"_blank\">Canada to Germany using a blockchain system</a>&nbsp;called Ripple. Typically, a transaction like this would take a few hours to complete. This one took eight seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many Albertans have family around the world. And sending money home can be a huge risk. Cost and safety are major issues. Ripple&mdash;or a future system similar to it &mdash;could negate these issues by depositing funds directly into a bank or cell phone account in seconds. No need to coordinate time zones for phone calls and ID verification. No need for your loved ones to anxiously carry cash home. Just an easy few seconds and a definite boost of happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not stopping at international transactions. We want to explore the possibility of creating secure digital identities that individuals have complete control over in a highly secure system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&rsquo;re certainly not ready to set up your identity record tomorrow, we&rsquo;re fully prepared to figure out how we can create this transformative experience for our customers and lead the way on what we consider one of the most exciting and impactful uses of the blockchain system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think of all the places your identity is currently stored. Rather than 10-20 different organizations having their own version of your identity, you could go through life with one consistent record, that you completely control, granting other parties access to it when necessary&mdash;to open a bank account, get a car loan or be approved for your first mortgage.&nbsp;</strong>This is the future ATB is exploring, with the help of blockchain technology. And our starting point is, of course, making banking work for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to be part of a team intentionally building for the future?

And then again when you return from lunch. And a coffee break. And when you need to zip out and grab something for dinner.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are you exhausted just thinking about it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The best kind of architecture is that which provides you with fewer hurdles to overcome in order to get to your destination, plus having a solid foundation you can build upon in the future. The result: agility, responsiveness and speed, without having to rethink the foundation each and every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been running ATB using an overly complex and resource-intensive Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) layer for a long time. That means that if we make changes to one element in our banking system, it impacts a significant number of other elements - forcing us to basically do an obstacle course through our own architecture. Think of it this way - if a service calls for XYZ, our ESB can provide ABC, but it has to hop over D-K and crawl under M-R before it can final go straight fromXYZ. This makes it complex to work with, not only for us, but for any third parties who require access to our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, our technological architecture has been slowing us down, so it&rsquo;s time for a change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve teamed up with the most experienced mobile technologies team in the market: IBM. Together, we&rsquo;ve built a digital lab where we&rsquo;re working on a very exciting new architecture for ATB. There are no lab coats here. Just some of the greatest minds from both IBM and ATB, creating a system that could entirely change the way we provide banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce17c830251eef2e37d5/1512623646363/ATB-AlphaBeta-Illustration-IMB.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest changes we&rsquo;re working towards is our project approach. We&rsquo;re leaving the waterfall approach to system architecture behind and focusing on faster technologies and methodologies. Rather than making a change to the system and having to wait to see if it&rsquo;ll have a negative impact on the whole system, we can work very quickly&mdash;think deploying a new feature in one month instead of eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if that feature doesn&rsquo;t work as planned? The system works both ways: we can fail fast and fix it fast, allowing ATB to be incredibly adaptable in a world where technologies are constantly changing. Does that sound like the type of place where you can succeed? Check out our<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;open positions</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This adaptability isn&rsquo;t due only to ditching the waterfalls&mdash;we&rsquo;re taking a leap far ahead of other banks and moving to an agnostic and highly scalable system. One which allows us to adopt and adapt third-party APIs, quickly bringing them to our customers through strategic partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can look forward to our first release with this approach&mdash;for mobile&mdash;around the end of the year. But remember, this is an ongoing journey. Internally, we&rsquo;re looking at new releases to existing platforms every couple weeks, so there&rsquo;s lots more to come. What we&rsquo;re hoping though, is that the technology gets so good it disappears. So...in all likelihood, you may not notice our back of house changes because things work as expected. And that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x1194\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28ce6353450a3ebfcbed93/1512623782116/static1.squarespace-3.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n","link":"","published_at":"06.12.2017","image_versions":{"v_768":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_768_article_image.jpg","v_500":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/070/v_500_article_image.jpg"},"slug":"don-t-go-chasing-waterfalls","tags":[{"id":16,"title":"Data"},{"id":6,"title":"Automation"},{"id":11,"title":"Cloud"}],"labs":[]},{"id":61,"title":"Transforming how we work: our journey to the cloud","image_url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/alphabeta-public-files/uploads/article/image/000/000/061/article_image.jpg","date":"15.11.2018 22:18","facets":["progress","business"],"archived":true,"featured":false,"featured_type":"technology","description":"<p>We&rsquo;ve been sharing the story of our G Suite adoption far and wide. And one of the questions we get often is &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t it disruptive?&rsquo; - the answer is yes, and that&rsquo;s what we were going for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As technology makes leaps forward, the next generation of consumers, and workers will be almost immune to OS updates and new product launches. Similarly, organizations large and small don&rsquo;t need to adopt latest and greatest technology, they need to learn to continually embrace change and disrupt themselves. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our transition to G Suite, we did not take the perspective of technology change or upgrade, but rather looked at it as an opportunity to look at how and why we do things, and really reimagine how we work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was more than simply moving files to the cloud, or copying formulas from an old spreadsheet to a Google Sheet, we approached the transition to G Suite as an opportunity to question everything about how we work. Asking &lsquo;does this provide value to customers? And &lsquo;how might we do this better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits of our transformation are much more than simply new tools, it is about a new mindset. For example, in our old mindset, team members would work on a document until completion before sending for comments, receiving feedback and then compiling. In our new mindset, we have adopted to a &nbsp;&lsquo;co-authoring&rsquo; approach where docs are shared from the outset, often before they are &lsquo;ready.&rsquo; This results in deeper and faster collaboration, but it is also an example of our changed perspective on genuine collaboration and vulnerability as individuals and as an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our journey to the cloud has been exciting and rewarding, so we want to share some of the highlights that enabled us to transform the way we work on our mission to empower team members to reimagine banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let the story guide you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.atb.com/about/Pages/our-story.aspx\">ATB story</a> is a guiding narrative for everything we do. Ultimately we want to create customer happiness. On our path to get there, we have the specific intention to make time richer. A goal that permeates every level of the organization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo when our G Suite transition team was evaluating how much email history to migrate to the cloud, the ultimate answer came down to valuing the time of our team members. Rather than encouraging staff to do a &lsquo;spring cleaning&rsquo; of their email, or asking them to manage with only 30 or 45 days of their email history during the transition, we made the choice to migrate our entire email history. When it came down to &lsquo;making their time richer,&rsquo; the decision was a no-brainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Forget &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizational change often comes with a scheduled &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; and a project plan that works backwards from that, with milestones and communication to staff members to keep them informed and to prime them for the big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did away with that entirely and essentially rolled out the G Suite to waves of early adopters. <strong>In the end, we had nearly 15% of the company as early adopters and teams were begging to have the full roll out so that the tools were available to all members. When &lsquo;launch day&rsquo; finally came, it was pretty much a non-event.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The psychological safety that came from having &lsquo;optional&rsquo; adoption, experts and gurus, and building excitement meant that they didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a change being inflicted on them when the time came. There was also no expectations that team members would become experts day one. Rather, as the organization moved through the transition, team members would grow to adopt and master the tools available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Self-select the leaders</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many organization, leadership would select team members to be seconded to special transformational projects. The G Suite launch team said no-way to that and instead we opted for self-selection, letting team members from across the organization apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was having a 50 person team known as the G Evangelists that were interested, passionate, and all-in to lead the charge. It also resulted in enormous diversity, pulling in everyone from branch team members from rural locations to managing directors from head office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It was extremely valuable to bring in the different perspectives of all teams who would be affected by the change and it was especially important that team members &lsquo;checked their titles at the door&rsquo; meaning that all team members were heard and valued for their diverse perspectives. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The self-selection process also was a great professional development opportunity for team members who might not otherwise have been exposed to the challenge. More than half of the G Suite adoption team ended up in different parts of the organization after being exposed to the change and showing their great skills and leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get executive on board </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem to make sense to leave the transition of the executive team to the end, making sure that all the kinks are worked out and that all of their staff are already on the new system. We took a bit of a different approach, giving &lsquo;white-glove&rsquo; service to our executives and their teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a real explosion point for our adoption, executives begging for more team members to be added to the adoption team, as they started seeing immense value in the tools. G+ communities, live video broadcasts, and competitions gave our staff access to executive team members like they had never had before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let team members guide themselves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you politely tell someone to &lsquo;Google it themselves?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of multi-hour training session and a dedicated help-desk, we wanted to enable peer-to-peer learning and let the organization support itself. We used G Suite tools and ingenuity to connect team members to support each other. For example, we had G Guides who acted as roaming support, looking for team members who might need help and for team members who couldn&#39;t find a G guide, we had physical signs at the desks of G Whizzes - indicating team members near you in the office who might have answers to your questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also saw enormous uptake of G+ communities - threads like &ldquo;Hey, did you know&rdquo; where people shared exciting features or capabilities that they discovered. And &ldquo;How do I&hellip;&rdquo; chats where team members can troubleshoot for each other, share expertise, and alleviate the need for dedicated experts and support teams. A storyteller collective also allowed team members to share stories of success and transformation to continue to excite and inspire others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of spending time doing in-person training sessions, we ran labs, inspired by the <a href=\"https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage\">Google Garage</a>, where, instead of technical lessons, we helped teams completely reimagine how they do their work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re fully on G Suite collaborating like rock-stars but, even more importantly, we&rsquo;re more ready than ever as individuals and an organization to adapt to changes that we know are coming our way. Ready to react, and not afraid to disrupt ourselves. Come along with us as we explore the future of banking and create happiness for Albertans.

No more &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; someone into defined channels (like bank branches, websites, and mobile apps). We&rsquo;re moving toward a new breed of banking that is conveniently intertwined with one&rsquo;s day-to-day life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In partnership with Finn.ai, we&rsquo;re thrilled to be the first bank in Canada to be working toward launching a banking chatbot. When it&rsquo;s live, you&rsquo;ll be able to text the chatbot through Facebook Messenger, asking it to perform different types of transactions. From&nbsp;<em>Interac</em>&nbsp;e-Transfers<em>,&nbsp;</em>to bill payments, and viewing transaction histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to integrate the chatbot with the Facebook Messenger platform because, so far, it&rsquo;s one of the only text-based platforms that&rsquo;s allowing outside bot APIs to develop new technology. Luckily it&rsquo;s a platform lots of people are comfortable using, and one of the most used phone apps driving a significant amount of user behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is made possible through a specific form of AI called Natural Language Processing. It allows the chatbot to learn from its own mistakes, bettering its ability to understand customer requests and respond accordingly over time. It&rsquo;s not perfect (yet), but it does provide a new way to bank where, when and how you want, and we&rsquo;re pretty optimistic about the chatbot&rsquo;s learning capacity when it comes to our long term project goals. We believe transactional capabilities are just table stakes for the much wider applications of a true Virtual Banking Assistant. The future of this will be much more like the movie&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;and much less like having a bank teller in your pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chatbots are new to banking, but not to people. Companies like Domino&rsquo;s have built chatbots you can text to order pizza. Pizza is pretty innocuous, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a big deal if the fact that you order pizza twice a week &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; to everyone you know. It&rsquo;s a bigger deal if it&rsquo;s your bank account info becomes public. So even though we&rsquo;re the first to integrate a banking chatbot into Facebook, we want to make sure we&rsquo;re refining toward a seamless and safe experience for users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c90f8165f56fcbfd614a/1512623015240/static1.squarespace-2.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re iterating our authentication module daily, and pairing technology with education. We&rsquo;ll focus on sharing best practices with users around device and information protection because you can never be too safe. The biggest risk happens when money moves out of an account&mdash;for that reason, we&rsquo;ve employed &ldquo;friendly money movement&rdquo; for our chatbot banking services, which restricts customers to transactions involving accounts that have already been set up and approved for the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Facebook Messenger is our first step, it&rsquo;s certainly not the only one. Beyond this social media chatbot, we&rsquo;re already exploring voice activation so that we can move into accessing the bot through systems like Siri, Google Home and Alexa. These interactions will be very different from their on-screen counterparts, but will still require our bot to learn the multiple ways basic questions can be asked (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my account balance?&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;How much money do I have?&rdquo;), among many other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a highly iterative process&mdash;we&rsquo;re always listening for feedback from our early adopters and customers to prioritize/implement new features and functionalities regularly. And we&rsquo;re proud to be partnering with amazing fintechs, like Finn.ai,&nbsp; to pave the way when it comes to offering you the ease of banking services no matter where you&rsquo;re spending your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanting to be part of innovative projects that disrupt the banking industry.

It&rsquo;s why one of our main focal points has always and will always be customer education and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID login on all of our apps, and we use retinal ID to serve the Boyle Street community in Edmonton, many of whom are homeless and can&rsquo;t get a bank account without traditional ID (more on this in September!). Now, we&rsquo;re looking to take things much further. Voice and facial recognition across multiple channels are the next stops on our road map.

Unlike your thumbprint or retinas, there&rsquo;s a lot that can interfere with voice recognition (street noise, laryngitis, etc.), and your face shape and appearance could change drastically from year to year depending on how life is treating you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our greatest barrier, however, is the imagination, and not technology. The fears surrounding biometrics have been interesting, to say the least. Many fear having their faces and fingerprints stolen&mdash;by way of a sharp cleaver to the wrist. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that we&rsquo;re not storing a photo gallery of facial scans and thumbprints. In fact, there are no images at all&mdash;just digital translations of your face, voice, and fingerprints on a database. Long story short, it&rsquo;d be much easier for someone to save your profile photo and throw it into Face Swap than hack our system. While possible, it would require next level skills and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As strong as biometrics are, two-factor authentication would always be in play: your device&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>a biometric token. Never&nbsp;<em>either or</em>. And despite increased security, there&rsquo;s no increased friction. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your phone. You don&rsquo;t leave your house without your fingerprints. You do the math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5a28c3a941920296526f5cd8/1512620979670/static1.squarespace-1.jpg?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond transporting you into your favourite sci-fi film, biometrics could continue to make significant social strides, especially when it comes to the underbanked: those who may not have the standard tools or resources required for traditional banking (things like ID or a stable mailing address). As we&rsquo;re learning through our work with Boyle Street, using biometric identification to help individuals secure their funds despite not having access to other basic services is potentially a game changer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about technology for technology&rsquo;s sake.

Supporting entrepreneurs &nbsp;is something we&rsquo;re really passionate about at ATB, from building entrepreneur centres, to crowdfunding/crowdlending platforms and an accelerator program. Now we&rsquo;re working on something that&rsquo;ll allow entrepreneurs in Alberta to access quality talent from their computer or mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, we launched a pilot of ATB Gigs: a way to connect Alberta business owners with people who can help them get stuff done. If it sounds really simple, that&rsquo;s because it is. We want entrepreneurs to be focused on the important stuff, and in order to do that, we know there&rsquo;s a lot of other work that has to come off their plates. But hiring a full-time employee isn&rsquo;t always the answer. Beyond the fact that paying another full salary may be out of reach, chances are entrepreneurs need help in a lot of different branches of their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s data entry, copywriting, event planning, emails, phone calls or folding promotional t-shirts for their next charity event, entrepreneurs can log into ATB Gigs, create a gig, and wait for the applications to pour in. For now, we&rsquo;ve got a pool of students who have gone through an extensive hiring process waiting to perform gigs, but eventually we plan to expand to others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our biggest focuses is on making this program valuable to everyone involved. The &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; can definitely become a race to the bottom, and we don&rsquo;t plan to let that happen on our watch. Yes, there are a lot of people who can perform tasks online for incredibly low (and potentially unethical) rates; tasks at ATB Gigs are performed by and for Albertans, and we&rsquo;re committed to providing a living wage as the bottom floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, we want to make sure that business owners are confident in the people they&rsquo;re hiring to perform gigs. Our talent goes through a high calibre screening before they&rsquo;re able to accept and perform gigs. And similar to other platforms like Airbnb, ATB Gigs will rely greatly on a ratings and review system to provide honest opinions before entrepreneurs click the &ldquo;hire&rdquo; button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still a lot details for us to fine tune before the official launch, with variables we&rsquo;d like to test along the way. For instance, we&rsquo;re exploring a system to put a portion of students&rsquo; pay directly into savings or investment, while also making sure the platform offers a life-changing solution to business owners. One that allows them to customize the hiring process and think about their business in an entirely new way and find unique and efficient ways our ATB Gigs team can truly help the days flow better. One that can even work as an HR &lsquo;testing&rsquo; tool, allowing business owners to &ldquo;trial run&rdquo; an employee, so to speak, before choosing to bring them on full-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever entrepreneurs can dream up for their business, we want to be there to help.

What you may not know is that while she seems pretty simple on the outside, there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to Pepper than meets the eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing we get asked a lot is what it&rsquo;s like to work with a robot. The completely honest answer is that it depends on her software. When she first arrived with her basic software, Pepper liked to answer questions about herself in a cute and funny manner. When we reprogrammed her, however, to focus on banking and a set of very specific tasks, a bit of her whimsy faded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let that get you down, though. Pepper isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; by any stretch of the imagination. We&rsquo;ve been learning so much about her, where she works best, and how she interacts with you (and vice versa) and iterating her software based on those learnings. Quite fittingly, one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned people prefer a polite robot; &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we work on improving Pepper&rsquo;s manners (and gradually moving her towards AI&mdash;something we&rsquo;ll elaborate on later), we&rsquo;re focusing on putting her to work in new contexts that aren&rsquo;t always based in our branch network. We think Pepper would be very helpful in situations where people need financial info but can&rsquo;t necessarily access it. Places like showhomes, where visitors may need to know more about how mortgages work, have their finances assessed, or get approved for a mortgage, or at university welcome weeks, where new post-secondary students may need to learn more about accounts or loans. We also want to test her out with creative entrepreneurs, so we&rsquo;re sending her to the Vignettes Design Series in Edmonton to meet with artists, designers, and other creatives and educate them about our upcoming arts and culture branch. When things get complicated, Pepper will always be accompanied by a human who can take over as required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it may sound like a lot, this phase of work with Pepper is actually quite short and sweet, and it&rsquo;s important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t a situation where you can judge a book by its cover. What you see in Pepper today, or tomorrow, or next week, isn&rsquo;t what you get. It&rsquo;s her insides&mdash;her software&mdash;that hold the real magic, and we&rsquo;re working furiously to get her to where she needs to be. One of the coolest parts about working with Pepper is that we don&rsquo;t actually know where she&rsquo;ll end up.&nbsp;<strong>The research is dictating the path over time, and every use case we test becomes either a building block or another step in the process of elimination.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while working with a robot may not be as cinematic as you think&mdash;sitting in a lab together having in-depth conversations with Pepper while various engineers connect wires to her, etc., etc.&mdash;we think she should definitely stay on your radar, because much is yet to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re always looking for talented people to join us on our journey.

You might be living in poverty. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have a safe place to sleep. Maybe &lsquo;home&rsquo; is an elusive concept instead of a place to go. You might be struggling with mental health challenges or addiction. All of these points of vulnerability could result in a situation where it&rsquo;s difficult to obtain - let alone hang onto - proper identification. And without identification, a safe place to keep the money that you do have isn&rsquo;t possible. For many in our community, this is their reality and a bank account - an opportunity to keep their money safe and grow their wealth - becomes a figment of the imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that access to banking is a basic right. With that guiding philosophy, enter Four Directions Financial, one way we&rsquo;re helping those in the Edmonton community that are vulnerable access banking, know that their money is safe, and maintain their pride and dignity. Part of ATB&rsquo;s agency network, Four Directions Financial is located next to Boyle Street Community Services, which has been serving inner-city Edmonton since 1971. We partnered in 2016, combining our financial and technological know-how with Boyle Street&rsquo;s expertise in supporting those in poverty, to provide vulnerable people access to mainstream financial services, often for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you walk inside the Boyle Street Community Services building, it looks like any other bank. But instead of requiring traditional ID, which is often lost or stolen, clients of this location can quickly and easily verify their identity through biometrics. As the first financial institution in Alberta to use biometric identification technology and the first in Canada to apply this technology to the underbanked, we use a simple, yet powerful black box to scan clients&rsquo; fingerprints and irises. Sixty-five per cent of Four Directions Financial&rsquo;s clients are registered to access their accounts through biometric identification. Others take advantage of Boyle Street&rsquo;s ID program (they use Boyle Street&rsquo;s address as their home address and then Boyle Street keeps the ID safe for them onsite).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to biometric technology, other unique features of Four Directions Financial include daily restrictions on withdrawals that are set by the customer, direct deposit of government cheques, and making the agency open to everyone&ndash;not just clients at Boyle Street.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With less time spent verifying IDs, more time is left for conversation. Marg, the Manager at Four Directions, knows many of her 520 customers by name. She spends time talking to clients about their lives and provides customized financial advice. Four Directions Financial merges relationship-based banking with cutting-edge technology. This affords hundreds of vulnerable people a safe place to store their money and take control of their finances. One-third of people who use Four Directions now have money left in their account at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work with biometrics extends beyond Four Directions - we&rsquo;ve already rolled out touch ID on all our apps and that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Upcoming advances include passive biometric solutions. We&rsquo;re currently conducting a proof of concept at the ATB Campus with facial recognition as a potential replacement for employee access cards, with a view to expanding to our customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As technology evolves, so too must our approach and application of it. After all, what good is transformation when it doesn&rsquo;t make life better for those of us that need it the most? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want a job that makes meaningful impacts on peoples&#39; lives?

That customer-centricity is at the heart of our mission, our strategy and our bottom line - as is a core driver to deliver happiness and provide value beyond banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it only makes sense that, in our mission to transform banking by leveraging new and emerging technologies, we look to how these technologies evolve our fundamental customer experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brain Lab, an initiative of ATB Leap&rsquo;s innovation lab, was created to take a research-based approach to exploring the relationships between technology, neurology, and psychology. Led by Dr. Trudi Chalmers, a Behavioural Neuroscientist and leader at ATB, The Brain Lab will utilize the efficiencies of Electroencephalogram (EEG) Machines to interpret activity in the brain associated with technology interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Areas of research for the Lab will include: Fundamental Research, Product Interfaces, Performance &amp; Wellness, and Physical Meets Digital - all through the power of brain activity data procured from EEG testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fundamental Research</strong> is the foundation of the lab: Brain Data. Curating extensive secondary research published by institutions (such as The University of Calgary), coupled with the production of The Brain Lab&rsquo;s own data, we will create the data infrastructure required to support and validate the accompanying research areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Product Interfaces</strong> will explore the opportunities in beneficial, affective computing with digital products used in market today. We believe we can create metrics for intuitive digital design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring published literature, existing psychological and sociological data, social media, ATB&#39;s existing databases, and primary neuroscientific and psychophysiological data, we&rsquo;ll be able to more deeply understand how our brain and mind respond to both internal and external stimuli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance &amp; Wellness</strong> recognizes a priority for sustained brain health for our team members and customers. We believe the future of work and products will include the importance of environments where people can engage in their most impactful, happy mental states - and understand potential impacts of product utilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s well established that the use of technology can have some significant impacts on the brain - a fact many who regularly use smartphones can likely attest. Yet, as the rate of innovation increases exponentially, we intend to research how these emerging technologies will impact us in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Physical meets Digital </strong>will begin to create the agnostic product architecture required for changes in digital interfaces - and perhaps prepare us for a world of brain-computer interfaces, and the future of the IoT (Internet of Things).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By pulling back the layers on our interactions with our technology, we can begin to isolate and test impacts of our own products on the brain health of our customers, while also gleaning insights to inform future neural modeling that can scale past the human experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of scientific insight and transformational technologies, we can evolve our commitment to the mental wellbeing of customers and team members, while informing future work in the ATB AI lab. The Brain Lab will be closely linked to our AI Lab, ensuring the findings, data, and ethical considerations are closely woven into development of emerging technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there is ongoing debate around whether Artificial Intelligence Networks can be modeled off of the human brain, we believe deeply understanding our own human networks and interpretations of learning is the most efficient place to start. This is just the beginning of a long line of experiments aimed at helping us better understand the human brain, and the emotions, behaviours and actions that make us who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we embrace digital transformation at ATB, we have a responsibility to our customers to be mindful of the impact of our products and services, right down to a neural level.

The application of deep reinforcement learning that was famously used for solving games like <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/\">Atari</a> with defined rules and bounds is being applied by our team of researchers to effectively turn &lsquo;banking&rsquo; into a closed game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by our North Star of zero dissatisfied customers, our AI Lab is finding novel, real world applications of advanced machine learning with the end goal of improving our customer strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We recently sat down with one of ATB&rsquo;s data scientists dedicated to the partnership, </strong><a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/ualberta/\"><strong>Mark Sebestyen</strong></a>, who is on a mission to gamify banking and will explain how his team applies reinforcement learning to their data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why gamify banking?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason that reinforcement learning techniques work well for solving atari games, for example, is due to the strict rules of games - at any given moment in a certain state there are a finite number of options or actions with clear end targets or rewards and future scenarios to run through to select an optimal move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we can do is come up with a strategic algorithm for banking. The &lsquo;game&rsquo; we are trying to optimize is a multifunction optimization problem. Essentially, maximizing customer value while simultaneously maximizing value for ATB given a specific set of constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banking is complicated and complex. After all, we&rsquo;re looking at the financial wellness of individuals and their business. In order to take this complicated context and simplify it into a well-defined context, we start by identifying the three key variables of solving any reinforcement learning games: states, actions, and rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee661cd8366b89fdf8ebd/1543431783715/1.png?format=2500w\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The state</strong> is the financial context vector augmented with information relevant to financial decisions, banking needs and personal behavioural data. For example, a time-series of account balances on what banking products a customer has, how long they&rsquo;ve been banking with ATB and what specific interaction patterns they portray. Like in the game of Monopoly, each customer is a &lsquo;player&rsquo;. At any given time, they occupy a certain location on the board, have a certain amount of money, and have certain features. And at each moment there are a number of options that they have in working towards their goal of winning the game. That is where the action part comes into play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The action </strong>could be a customer action or an action taken by ATB. For example, offering a product, change of interest rates, or consultation on financial goals all the way down to the granularity of adjusting and personalizing the UI experience for that customer while they are logged into their online banking platform. Really our goal was to systematically go through all the actions we as ATB can digitally adjust for our customers and let our engine use those to come up with the best strategy for these clients. As an example, a feature product that can be powered by our engine is a digital banking platform that can continuously learn from and adopt to varying customer needs and will continue to learn more and more from ATB customers the more they use the platform. This is the most state of the art solution to deep personalization (this algorithm is literally straight out of the hot oven of RL research) and, to our knowledge, ATB could be the first bank that is using anything like this in application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The reward.</strong> Once an action has been taken in a certain state, the monopoly piece moves to a different position on the board. Here, we can evaluate whether financial value (e.g. investment portfolios as well as customer lifetime value, etc.) and other customer experience factors have increased, decreased, or remained the same. We do this through our own internal algorithms in combination with utilizing customer feedback and incorporation of survey results. As an example, after every google hangout session you get a mini-survey asking about the smoothness of the call. Similarly for us, these micro opinions can be easily incorporated into the platform and can provide huge value in custom tuning and deeply personalizing the UI/UX experience. For changes to our digital experience, a measure of reward may be the number of clicks it took to complete an action. For customer satisfaction and happiness, we may measure if they have moved further towards their indicated financial goals or look at how their engagement scores have changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"427x256\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc\" data-image-resolution=\"1000w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee67303ce64aca78d7ffc/1543431828017/2.png?format=1000w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Source: Mark Sebestyen, ATB</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, <strong>problem constraints</strong> map out the boundary conditions - eg. everyone would be happy with a low or no interest MasterCard, but that is not something that we can necessarily offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that banking is not a game where you can boundlessly experiment with clients, which is why we are also committed to developing what we call in RL robust models. Thus, for example, our decision engine won&rsquo;t offer a MasterCard to a client already possessing that very product. In our models, this can be achieved by enforcing strict penalties for approaching bounds or violating game rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the K of N learner is a state of the art reinforcement learning technique for improving model robustness that we borrow from researchers on our team (Dr. Bowling and Dustin Morrill) as they employed similar techniques in solving the <a href=\"https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/michael-bowling\">game of Poker</a>. Test</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cepheus, a poker-playing program, was developed by one of the lead researchers on our <a href=\"https://ai.atb.com/about/\">ATB AI team</a>. Dr. Michael Bowling&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s algorithm is able to play a nearly perfect game of Heads-up Limit Texas Hold&#39;em. To quote Dr. Bowling, &ldquo;It is so close to perfect that even after an entire human lifetime of playing against it, you couldn&#39;t be statistically certain it wasn&#39;t perfect. We call such a game essentially solved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our &ldquo;game of banking&rdquo;, we sample N function distributions of the model at random from infinitely many choices while an antagonist fixes K of these distributions. The purpose is to train the protagonist to outplay the antagonist no matter how non-advantageous his fixed choices are. We need to still be able to choose the best solution regardless of what the adversarial fixed factors were. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"764x430\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-image-id=\"5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" data-load=\"false\" data-position-mode=\"standard\" data-src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a13298312abd9459337021c/t/5bfee6bf0e2e722802ebaeb3/1543431876550/1+%281%29.png?format=2500w\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:8px;\"><em>Photo by: Dustin Morrill, PhD Student - AI</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional robustness is provided by testing our engines on certain data sets where states, actions, and rewards are very well defined, allowing us to closely monitor results and test robustness of our systems in the iteration process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are applying advanced machine learning models and computer systems to solve the problem of banking, we haven&rsquo;t lost touch with the humans behind it.

These powerful AI algorithms are capable of solving games by coming up with best strategies - called policies in RL - to play them.

With Jackie&rsquo;s award winning work in designing service experiences across multiple industries including hospitality, health care, and business, and time spent working around the world, we knew she would help open up the possibilities and bring fresh perspectives to our in-branch experience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of our day-to-day activities shift online, from shopping, to catching up with friends, to changing details of our mortgage terms, so many experiences have gone from in-person to digital. This means that the role of bank branches and human-to-human customer service is continually evolving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As we explore the value that we create through in-branch experiences, there are many lessons to learn from outside the banking industry.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the medical sector, there is a strong emphasis on &lsquo;helping&rsquo; and providing medical care. However, there is often a lack of &lsquo;service&rsquo; in the traditional sense. Think of the frustration of not knowing how long you&rsquo;ll be waiting in line or in a waiting room, not being welcomed with a friendly greeting, or having limited access to the information or services you need online. Not to mention the additional stress and anxiety of a sterile, crowded waiting room that adds to an already tense experience as you await medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrast this to entering a high-end hotel, where every part of the sensory experience is aimed at fostering a particular atmosphere and each staff member has the innate desire to serve and please guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a hotel, the arrival experience is critical. The sights and smells of a hotel lobby instill emotion&mdash;think of the cozy luxury of walking into the Fairmont Palliser in Calgary or the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton&mdash;or the energetic vibe of entering a W Hotel with vibrant colours and hip music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Of course, our goal is not to replicate a hotel experience within bank branches. The inspiration we have taken is about the human-centered approach to designing a space and providing optimized service through atmosphere and emotion that resonates with customers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In designing our branches, we are purposeful in understanding the emotional state of customers when they enter, what they are looking to achieve, and how we can utilize space and technology to optimize how we deliver value and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One difference in banking is that the experience starts before a customer actually walks through the door. Entering a branch might be the third step in the customer&rsquo;s journey, as they &nbsp;may have already tried to process a transaction at an ATM or find the information online. When they enter a branch, they are looking to be assured that their problem will be solved, that they will be treated like a valued customer, and that their time will be well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we elevate the arrival experience in a branch? The first step we are taking is a co-creation process with our customers and branch team members to discover more about the emotional state and desires of customers when they enter. This will help us to design spaces and provide insights into how our customer service representatives can solve problems and alleviate stress for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the service side, language is a very important tool in the atmosphere created by staff.&nbsp;<em>Help&nbsp;</em>vs&nbsp;<em>Serve</em>.&nbsp;<em>Patient</em>&nbsp;vs&nbsp;<em>Guest</em>. A shift in language (think financial caregiver) can provide a framework that impacts each interaction that takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our branches are an extension of our brand. They provide the opportunity for us to listen carefully to the needs of our customers and use the in-branch experience to learn more, build personal connections, and help Albertans on their financial journey.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In transforming ATB in-branch experiences, we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from everywhere, but our end goal is simple: for customers to leave feeling like they are one step closer to their financial goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in joining Jackie Mcatee and her team as they work to reimagine the branch experience?

But at ATB that&rsquo;s exactly what we strive to be. Being a large organization in an industry that is heavily regulated and risk-averse, it can be easy to stick to the same way of doing things because it&#39;s always been that way. However, we have always believed in finding the best and most value-driven solutions that serve Albertans &ndash; and that means being agile and forward thinking. One way we do this is by encouraging teams to leverage technology to create value-driven products quickly. We call these quick time to value projects and these projects are &nbsp;proven successful. The beauty of quick time to value projects is success comes almost immediately, as opposed to longer-term projects that take many years to provide all their value at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to deliver value to our customers, we need to deploy the right technology and tools for our teams. How can we make their days more efficient so that their time can be focused on what matters most: the people we serve? Enter ATB&#39;s Enterprise Data Science (EDS) team. They&#39;ve been working on clever ways to leverage existing technology to drive value within our organization by being dedicated to using data science techniques to solve everyday banking problems and ramp up efficiencies across multiple business units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the EDS-built tools now in use at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>The EDGuR1 chatbot</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Digging for information in a database, updating a timesheet, trying to remember the right acronym ... There are so many small, seemingly simple tasks and transactions that we (and all workers) do each day that add up and take away from our time that could be better spent on value added tasks. Built using the tools available within Google Cloud Platform, the EDS team created a fully functioning chatbot named EDGuR1 that provides team members fast access to hard to find, but easy to describe resources. The time savings EDGuR1 provides our team members, at a few minutes each day can amount to many people-hours saved &nbsp;on mundane task and instead on tasks that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Within two weeks EDS was able to build, deploy, and scale the chatbot at a very low cost and with minimal effort. Happier team members. Happier customers. Such a simple deployment of technology using existing tools and APIs had small, but transformational effects on the daily routines of ATB team members and is one of our favorite examples of quick, high value projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Optical Character Recognition</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">As a financial institution with significant business clientele, we regularly receive large amounts of financial information from clients, especially on business loans that are margined. In the past, this task required 12 full-time team members to go through each statement and manually enter information to calculate future loan values. It&rsquo;s a big task to say the least, and it takes away from our team members&rsquo; time &ndash; which is better spent on building client relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">In the past margined loans have been managed efficiently, and possible solutions of increasing efficiency are expensive and time consuming, often requiring third-party expertise. Instead our EDS and internal <em>Operation Automate</em> team collaborated over a short time period to develop a cloud-based automation tool leveraging Optical Character Recognition. This tool reads the text from incoming financial statements for margined loan accounts, and automatically extracts the right information and calculates the new margined loan amount, providing the customer with near-real-time access to their updated loan amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about how EDS built and deployed these solutions, we&rsquo;ll post an in-depth piece on this next time.

In our drive to lead the technology revolution of the banking sector, we&rsquo;ve been sharing our passion for areas like blockchain, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;<strong>This focus allows us to leverage a willingness to provide business banking solutions that go beyond traditional offerings.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a business banking client comes to ATB and says &lsquo;Sooooo, we&rsquo;re doing something a little different&hellip;,&rdquo; here at ATB, our ears perk up and we say &lsquo;how can we help?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s in our interest to make Alberta businesses across all sectors of the economy as competitive as possible and to make Alberta a place known for our openness to innovation: a great place to start and grow technology businesses.&nbsp;<strong>That is what we are setting out to do by working with businesses to create banking solutions that fit how business is done now and how it will be done in the future.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the oil and gas sector facing tighter margins, and the renewables sector exploding, the energy sector in particular is starving for innovative solutions and increased efficiency. We shared with you a while back our excitement about a blockchain proof of concept we have been working on for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/article/transactions-so-slick-you-might-slip\" target=\"_blank\">settling transactions for contracts in the oil and gas sector</a><a href=\"https://atbalphabeta.com/articles/49/\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re also supporting the great work of companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guild1.co/2018/02/14/guildones-royalty-ledger-settles-first-royalty-contract-on-r3s-corda-blockchain-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">GuildOne</a>; their innovative solution is streamlining fulfillment of smart contracts for oil royalty payments. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with royalty settlements in this space, think of an analogy of the music industry. When a song plays on the radio, there are a number of parties that may receive royalties at different rates: the artist, the song writer, a producer, etc...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contract and rates have been agreed to in advance, but when it actually comes down to payment, there may be different electronic copies of the contract flying around. Each party may perform the calculation themselves and then when payment comes through, if there are any discrepancies, it can result in huge delays and the need for many man hours of calculations, reissuance of payment, and a lot of time wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart contracts living on the blockchain can eliminate much of the waste and discrepancy by cementing the contract terms into a distributed ledger.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of oil royalty payments, contract negotiations are done separately and then cemented on the blockchain. Since ATB can read only the payment details of the smart contract directly from the blockchain, when a transaction is confirmed an Electronic Funds Transfer comes through and ATB initiates the fund transfer between parties. The smart contract in place truly is &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, we only see what we need to, which is the payment details. All other terms are kept confidential amongst the negotiating parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like a simple process, because it is.&nbsp;<strong>ATB&rsquo;s important role is our willingness to think outside of traditional banking.&nbsp;</strong>What we&rsquo;ve brought to the table is the option to initiate money movement based off payment instructions from a blockchain, rather than someone listed with signing authority on an account. Without this ability, fund transfer would have to be initiated manually by the payer, eliminating much of the benefit of the smart contract and the trust and reliability created by the blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no magic to it, but this is exactly what we&rsquo;ve been training for.&nbsp;<strong>We don&rsquo;t simply provide financial solutions based on traditional banking principles, we help businesses find solutions that fit the specific problems they are trying to solve and we bring our experiences with exponential technologies to the table.&nbsp;</strong>Are you looking to be part of the change that makes banking work for our Alberta businesses? Start your journey now,&nbsp;check out our open positions with the ATB transformation team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.atbalphabeta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working on other proofs of concept that provide creative business banking solutions, for example real-time money movement off a blockchain. Our willingness to provide innovative business banking solutions is not limited to blockchain, as we continue to explore areas on the leading edge of technology, we&rsquo;re positioned to help Alberta businesses with the banking solutions of tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doing something a little different in business?

Although many assume these are on the distant horizon, we often forget that these are tools being put into MVP, pilot and practice across industries today. At ATB, one of our explorations into the combination of AI, Blockchain and automation is our application EVA, that has been deployed for more than 6 months across the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA (Easy Voice Autonomation) is one of the most nimble and effective projects related to AI, blockchain, and automation, and has the ability to exponentially transform banking. EVA is currently being leveraged within ATB to help us with our commitment to listen to our customers. Based on this commitment, we are focusing on improving the customer transactions experience &nbsp;that has resulted in negative feedback due to mistakes being made or the time taken to complete the task. We&rsquo;re also taking an &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; approach with EVA, by experimenting with EVA internally and gaining feedback from our team members prior to making it directly available to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blockchain we are using records processes, but not customer data. These processes are recorded where everything is secure and encrypted, as well as restricted by access permissions. &nbsp;This technology was chosen to enable solutions that are open and scalable, while ensuring its not dependent on a singular platform that could prevent us from expanding in the future. We chose to take on the challenges of blockchain to be at the forefront of this technology, exploring how we can use it to do what we do best: serve our customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A current use case for EVA is the ability to save team members time and repetitive work when it comes to something as simple as changing an address. &nbsp;Connecting to the Canada Post API ensures the proper format of the address, saving ATB time and money on address remediation that many companies face in their customer records. Team members are able to enter address updates in one place and have that disseminated by the software robots who are fulfilling the request to each individual book of record where the information is required. &nbsp;Be it a customer profile, Mastercard or Investment account, customers can rest assured that all their accounts are updated accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the future, the goal is for EVA to anticipate our customers needs and take the onus off the customer for things such as address updates. Observables will allow for people to choose who can see and share their information and allow companies to pre-emptively update requirements when customer share. Imagine not having to call every company with whom you interact to update your address when you move, just simply allow these companies to listen for the updates you choose to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of EVA within ATB is to be able to rapidly create solutions that can transform the way we work and ultimately provide better customer service. It is because of this that we&rsquo;ve also&nbsp;chosen to incorporate natural language processing to better capture, translate, and figure out what the user is trying to accomplish when working with a given solution. The aim is to simplify every day tasks and make us more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EVA has been embraced by our robotics processing team and they are using EVA to build solutions for team members. As these solutions have been rolled out throughout the organization, it has allowed us to determine what features people inherently use, and which features need prompting, encouragement and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVA allows branches and departments to solution for themselves, as opposed to being dependent on traditional IT departments or software development teams. This &ldquo;self serve&rdquo; ability saves time, money and manpower. EVA enables everyone to be part of the solution. &nbsp;We currently have 24 processes deployed internally to our team members that are fulfilled on the backend by our software robots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of EVA could be in a myriad of directions, as what we&rsquo;ve built is malleable and scalable which allows for future pivots and iterations. We could look at different use case applications within ATB, or even give back to the open source community by sharing knowledge with (and learning from), the incredible developer talent in our own backyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are committed to transformation at ATB and our stories are not done yet.

For any high performance team, it&rsquo;s THE F-word. So what does it <em>really</em> mean to celebrate failure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The dictionary may define failure as &lsquo;a lack of success,&rsquo; but for us, the definition just doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. Here is how we define failure in a way that allows us to celebrate and learn from it at ATB:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Recognizing when you&rsquo;ve taken the wrong path in reaching a particular goal and either switching paths or becoming stronger from taking the long way. Just because you are on the wrong path doesn&rsquo;t mean that you won&rsquo;t eventually get to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&lsquo;Failure&rsquo; is a temporal state on the path to a solution&mdash;like a baby learning to walk, an individual fall does not mean that success is not the ultimate outcome. In embracing and learning from mistakes and failures, we are ensuring our eventual success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We learn by doing, instead of watching. Being the first to attempt something new is a great way to increase your chances of failure, but we are brave enough to try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move through our transformation and adopt an agile mindset across the organization, it is crucial for our leadership and team members across ATB to have a common understanding of what failure is and why we celebrate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The micro failures, the day-to-day choices and decisions that come with the agile mindset are opportunities to be humble, correct our path, and learn quickly from our mistakes. This pivot in thinking is part of how we can shift from incremental change to 10X leaps. Being able to change paths, or adjust the target entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve got the tools to help team members think and talk about failure in a way that helps move us forward. Things like a failure toolkit with survey insights, our definition of failure and the reasoning behind this shift in mentality. We engage, leveraging internal platforms such as transformation talks and G+ communities where we socialize and reflect on individual and team failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to think of it, you might say that we have already &lsquo;failed&rsquo; at celebrating failure. With our most recent surveys showing only 50% of the organization aligned with our definition successfully celebrating failure. We may not be at our target yet, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we won&rsquo;t get there. Whether we are developing new banking tools, or working to change our company culture, we take the learnings and celebrate failures, because we have faith it will make our solutions even stronger.

As we become more rapid in our delivery, top of mind for us is how we can ensure we have the right talent at the right time to help us keep up the pace. Delivering on transformation cannot happen without the best talent. Enter: Transformer X, a Transformation Talent Accelerator within ATB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This immersive program combines up and coming tech talent with broad and deep immersion into the work of ATB Transformation. We anticipate that the initial cohort of 20-25 successful applicants are future-ready and eager to roll up their sleeves &ndash; enabling us to deliver upon our transformation mandate and stand out as a cutting-edge, innovative organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s eligible?</strong> Recent graduates or professional with under three years experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transformer X is a great opportunity for graduates of Alberta institutions who want to build careers in industries such as computer science and software engineering to work through a paid and fully immersive experience straight out of their program. We also see a lot of early stage practitioners in the tech space accelerating their career through this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For eight months, participants will work directly with ATB&rsquo;s 1,000 person-strong team of Transformers - the members of our Transformation team who every day are striving to make a mark in a rapidly changing world with a relentless desire to transform banking and make it work for people. Participants will be considered ATB team members from day one with exposure to tough projects and real responsibilities through hands-on, fast-paced experiences guided by ATB&rsquo;s leaders in a highly agile delivery environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the eight-month time frame, our goal is to have every participant of Transformer X move into a full-time role at ATB, so that together we can grow the innovation/technology ecosystem in Alberta. Imagine, having the best minds work and play in cities that are affordable, have a lot on the go and offer an unparalleled quality of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes us really excited about Transformer X is that it&rsquo;s an equal opportunity learning experience. We expect to learn from our participants as much as they are learning from us. That&rsquo;s why cohort 1 is small and nimble, to help us shape and break the program in order to ensure we can deliver great value to the talented minds that join us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transformer X comes at a time that is important to all Albertans. Young professionals are looking for meaningful and exciting career opportunities. As a society, we are on the verge of a significant shift in the way we live, thanks to technology. Transformer X is a step towards building a strong local economy with a robust job market, in an innovative industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first cohort of Transformer X starts in April and will run through to December 2019.
